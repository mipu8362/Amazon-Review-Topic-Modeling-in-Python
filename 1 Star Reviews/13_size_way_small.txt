B000R4XHRC had to return The sizing was way off. I wear a size 7 so that is what I ordered. These were more like an 8. I had to return them.
B000R4XHRC maybe a nice shoe but asian small. ordered 1/2 size larger than my normal shoe size and there was no way I could have worn the thing all day. Way too  narrow even though I ordered a D!.
B000TYJVBG Great shoes Initially the shoes looked small for the size 13 I had ordered but they fit well and are confortable. The look and function well. They were shipped quickly also.
B00160EGW6 Sizing was off I love these pumas!!!!  The only problem I had with these was the sizing.  I have two other pairs of these style of shoes in different colors.  All three are a men's size 8.5.  For some reason this particular pair is a little too big. Other then that they are great shoes.
B001B516CE Excellent product Had an old pair of these but in Blue. They've lasted forever. Was a bit nervous about the size because normally I wear size 12, but I ordered a 13 because Pumas are quite small. They fit perfect, they're extremely comfortable and they look great!
B001CHG1YY love it i returned the size 12 for  13 and they are great. I will order other styles soon. Takes me back to my childhood.
B001CHG1YY Sizing not accurate. I liked the shoe, but it was way too large for my foot. It was recommended to order 1/2 size larger, didn't work.
B001CHG1YY good but The toe area is a little too narrow for a big guy with a shoe size of 13.  Need more squared off approach
B001CHG1YY Nice Classic sneakers ,men's shoes really I believe these shoes are listed as Uuisex because there is no wide sizes.The size tag  on my size 13 is the standard 12 UK 47 EUR 13 US for a men's size.There is nothing on the box that is different.So these are the same shoes that are listed as" Men's" on Puma web site.They are are true size 13 IMO ,what I mean by this is because of vanity sizing and heavier people ,every item of clothing sold in USA is bigger ,but these shoes used a pattern that is from the 1980s.I also got a pair of Puma S shoes in size 13 in the same order.They where way too big and I had to exchange for size 12.Google "Vanity sizing" and you will see what I mean,it started with womens clothes but now has spread to men's.These shoes are great ,love the extra lacrs and very comfortable.They are sneakers and not training shoes,I find them comfortable but everyone is different.
B001E1EJ1U Much smaller than expected. My daughter currently wears a 13.5 so I bought a size up (1) just in case and it was way too small.  The other 1s (different brand) that I bought were a little large as expected confirming my size selection.  These will need to be exchanged for a much larger size.  Otherwise, both my daughter and I liked them.
B002EENI40 Sizing Way OFF Giving this item 4 stars because they looked like they are made well.  I had to return them as they were way too large.  Ordered a size 7 and they just fell off.  Other than the sizing, they seemed to be made well.
B002EL3KQE Too small My son was a size 11/11.5 tried the 12 and it was way too small.  We sent back and ordered the 13.5.  They are a little too big but he is a growing boy and he will soon grow into them.  He loves them.
B002EL3KQE Just felt it was a tad small Great shoes and looks very nice. My son is 6 1/2 and about 55 pounds, just a normal skinny 6 yr old. This sneaker seemed to be too narrow for his thin legs. He currently wears a 13 and so I got a 13.5, but it was still tight and he has issues putting them on. He has to remove both straps to get his foot in and when the straps are closed they look short and expose velcro. Overall a nice shoe, but order at least a size up.
B002EL3KQE Great shoes My son loves them, they really are great looking everyone has complemented on them, my son is a size 12.5 or 13 I bought the size 13 it does fit just fine but I wish I had bought 13.5 since it is a little narrow at the toes. Hopefully he won't outgrow them to soon.
B002EL3KQE I love the lightining cat These sneakers are so cute they look better in person but the material is very hard for my son, his feet is wide & fat so the velcro only closes to half. My son is an 11 and I ordered size 13 but still kind of tight I should of got them 13 But I didnt return them.  He felt in love with them and after a few times he wore them they began to strech a little and I got him thiner socks so his feet dont't feel so uncomfy.. He loves when His cat start lighting.  He always wanted lightining shoes but I never liked them.. But these puma are nice..
B003EE9L0E My boyfriend loves these Strange situation, I bought these for my boyfriend. I bought them in his size which is a 12.  Too small.  So I returned them to Amazon at a loss by the way.  I was charged for return shipping since it wasn't the seller's error.  They run small which was unknown to me at the time of purchase.  I bought a size 13 from a competitor and he loves them. I also purchased the matching PUMA socks for him.  Overall great purchase but I wish I had known they run small.
B003EE9P14 cute but size is off Cute shoes but sizing is way off. I usually wear an 8 and got these in 7.5 and they're at least a size too big.Bought them for zumba class but cannot wear them due to sizing problems :(
B003EEBGQQ Great comfortable shoes that look nice. I like Pumas and have a couple pairs now. This shoe is attractive and comfortable which was what I was I have come to expect from Puma. Just like everyone here seems to say if you normally wear 12's in other brands then size up when getting Puma's. The 13's I ordered fit me perfectly.
B003EEH7NM not good for a 7 yars old I purchased 2 pairs of this. 1st broke after a 14 days and the second the next day from a day of purchase. I guess it is some kind of wrong design because both pair broke same way.
B003IMJO68 Love these socks The socks are very comfortable. I have size 13 feet and usually size 10-13 socks are very tight on me and they start sliding down my ankle and in to my shoe. These socks rest just below your ankles. These were tight at first but after the wash they were fine. I fine these socks to be very comfortable, they let my toes breethe and haven't seen any holes yet after three months. I have ordered more since and am quite happy
B003LY4LL6 Sizing has changed They were too long - I've owned 2 pairs in the past that fit the same, but these were an inch too long in the toe of the shoe. Along with being lighter weight, they must have changed the sizing too?
B003LY4X2S PUMA's for the new Millenium Looking for a stylish pair of black sneaks came across these puma's. As we know puma's are cut small, but this particular model got good reviews on sizing, so gave them a try. They are definitel cut a tad bit larger than other puma models. Normally wear a 13 sneaker, got these in a 14, and suprising the cut on these are big and spacious. Good job PUMA on making a sneaker that doesn't fit like a glove.
B003ZJCEXO Size is way off I ordered a Medium size, but when it came it was way too big.  So much so that i could wrap it around.  This jacket ft more like an XL.
B003ZW2FJO These pants are awesome, like them better than adidas tiro 13's These pants are awesome, like them better than adidas tiro 13'sThere length was perfect, had zippered pockets, look and feel excellent!
B0042ANHUE Size runs a little small These shoes seem to fit like an 11.5 instead of a 12 and there is no arch support for a medium to high arch nor is there room for an orthotic to correct this problem. The quality is better than average and the sole grips very well on most surfaces. I wish I had purchased a 13 but the largest size offered was the 12.
B0049J57OM CAUTION!! OMG AAAHH These shoes feel A MAZING!! but they are a bit to small and i got a size 13 so then i returned it and am waiting for the 14 hopefully they'll fit a little better but other than that they're great and your foot just rolls as you run SOOOO much better than running with nike shox or some heavy a$$ shoe
B004DKQY0I good overall When i first got these in the mail my first impression was, Wow they are sharpe looking! The look of these spikes have every aspect that i was looking for. So I give the look 5 stars without a dought. The comfort was great, just the right amount of cushion. The only downside was the sizing. In sneakers i wear a 13, so thats what size i Got these in, well i ended up returning them to get a size 12, 13 was too big. So they do run a size big and as a track runner you want them to fit just right.
B004GB0SNS SOME Pumas tend to run small I had a size 12 pair of Puma &#34;The Basket&#34; that might have been a quarter size too big.  I got a pair of size 12 Puma &#34;Elite:&#34; I couldn't even squeeze my foot into it; their size 13 is JUST big enough.  Pumas with a round toe, like &#34;The Basket,&#34; seem to be sized accurately, but the pointier-toed sneakers, like the &#34;Elite,&#34; and apparently these, run smaller, like they didn't take into account the fact that they taper at the toe.
B004GB11O8 Nice Shoes My son really liked these shoes in the store but couldn't find them in a size big enough (14), so we ordered them online and got exactly what we expected at a good price.  He wears size 14 in Nikes also so the sizing is comparable.
B004GB11O8 Not all Puma's Fit the Same I have a pair of Puma's that are size 13, however I am a 12 in these. Unfortunately I couldn't exchange these and get another size for the discounted price. So better luck next time.
B004GB1242 Crap The "13" is actually a 14, good job wasting my time. Giving them to my brother, at least he got something out of this.
B004GB1242 wish they made 12 1/2 i have had pumas over the years. some fit better than others. I usually go with the 13 because my true size, 12 1/2, is not available. the whirlwinds seem to be a larger 13 than the romas I have had in the past. I put some extra thick insoles in them to compensate for some of the roominess and that seemed to work a little.Oh well; they were only $31 so, I will use them for the gym.The shoes that fit me the best by far seem to be converse and onitsuka tigers - they make 12 1/2. If only the other shoe companies started too as well.
B004GB14HM Great shoes I just bought these and they are just comfortable and great-looking shoes! The size is just a little bit small. I'm currently a size 13 1/2 and I bought 14 and they fit perfectly! They hold to the court when playing sala! Totally recomend them!
B004J4XNNO Sizing.... What's up with the sizing on these. I usually wear a 9, but paid attention and bought a 9.5. They are still a little squishy tight and can only hope they loosen a bit.Commented in my follow-up... the blister is to my smaller foot and it's not because my foot was sliding around.A big waste of money...
B004K00GLE Fit well and so far so good I'm a newly minted U6 soccer coach and bought these so I wouldn't fall on my rear (or any of the kids) as I run around the field with them.  You can't just tell a bunch of 4 and 5 year olds to do some drills, you have to do them too.  I honestly don't notice when I have them on, so I'll say that's a very good thing.  I'm obviously not running in them for an hour for a full soccer match, but still moving around.  No blisters or anything.  They seem well made and will suit me just fine for coaching.  I don't anticipate having to buy another pair.Other thoughts: I almost didn't buy these because another reviewer complained about the size 14 being small on their size 13 feet.  I wear a size 14 shoe in everything from running shoes (Nike, Brooks, NB) to sandals (birkenstock, teva, cheap flip flops) and these fit me perfectly.  I wonder if there was a manufacturing issue where perhaps some shoes were mislabeled. No problems with sizing on these.  I'm glad I got them.
B004K00GLE Quality Shoe Great Shoe for your Money.  It was smaller than my usual size 13 shoes, but it expanded to my size in time.  The reason for four stars is because it was some what smaller that what I expected.  I suppose 13 D is smaller than normal size 13.
B004PA21ZI Puma Cell Sorai Shoes I like Puma shoes and am pleased with this pair. The price was right, the service was easy, and the shipping was efficient. I normally take a 12 or 13 men's size; however, my experience is that Pumas run a bit small, so I ordered size 13, and the shoes fit very well. I ordered with confidence in amazon that, had the size been wrong, I could have had a prompt exchange or refund, but it was not necessary.
B004S08HE4 Looked ok but... I bought two pairs of these pants (size 14/16) for my 13 year old son. He is about 5' 4&#34;. Both were way too short. Bought the same size of Filas and they fit just fine.
B004SUANZU Runs small I typically wear a size 14 and these size 14 shoes were too small for me. They're certainly a sharp looking shoe though. I love Puma stuff normally, but their shoes are hit or miss when it comes to sizes. I have pumas in size 14 and 15, depending on the style.
B004T6IXUK Good I got this shoes on time, I got it from Shoesontheweb. Had no problem. The shoes as described.A very important thing you have to consider is that in this Puma brand the sizes are kind of small, I ordered Sz 12 and I really should have ordered Size 13, consider ordering one number up from yours.Overall a good pair oh shoes to wear with anything you want, shorts, jeans, sport :D
B004VRIGRM Very comfortable I bought these shoes to wear as my "everyday" shoes. they are very comfortable and provide good arch support. The size was as-advertised (meaning i wear a size 13 and this size 13 fit properly. i have had issues with different brands where a size 13 does not fit).
B004WLEF6S Shoes for my husband My husband is a size 14 foot, and finding that size in stores is almost impossible. I was excited to see Amazon offered these in a 14.
B004ZIP5GW Great shoes my son was impressed I ordered these for my son for Christmas he loves them he did tell me he usually wears a 12 we got them in a 13 because they run smaller great product!!
B004ZIP5GW Slick looking, comfortable shoes Was able to snag these on a gold box deal for roughly $40.Could not be more pleased. They seem very very durable and they look great.One thing to note that you may not notice in the pictures (I sure didn't) is that these shoes DO NOT have a &#34;tongue&#34;The part where a separate tongue would be is actually fully attached and the same material that wraps around the side of your feet and your heel.  It's hard to explain but it's not a problem, just a unique thing I didn't expect when I pulled them out of the box.I will say they do seem to run a hair small? Historically I would wear size 13 nike's but my last 2 pairs of shoes (sketchers go runs) and these, have both needed to be size 14.
B004ZIT63U These shoes run extra-extra Small I got these for my 6 year old she wears an 11 1/2 in shoes so I always get 1/2 size larger so she has room to grow ... They didn't have a size 12 so I ordered the 12 1/2 ... They fit perfect so I sent them back and re-ordered ( they had sizes 13 & 13 1/2 ) but I ordered a size 1 .... And they fit with a little room to grow .... Love these shoes but they seem to run extra - extra small ...
B004ZIT63U Nice Style WAY Too Small This shoe does not fit my son's foot at all, he wears a 12 so I got a 12.5 so he could grow into them but he could barely get his foot in them. Hopefully I won't have trouble sending them back.
B004ZIT63U Somewhat small My son wears 13.5 and another brand with 13.5 size fits more comfortably than these shoes. I am hoping that after usage few times these shoes will feel as comfortable as the other ones.
B004ZIT63U Great kids sneaker We got our kiddo a pair of Puma sneakers when school started. They really held up to wear & tear. Ordered these to replace the ones prior due to growth.This shoe runs small in sizing. In other shoes she wears a 13-13.5; she fit a 1.5 in this shoe.The insole is fantastic: remove the insole and sit the child's foot onto it for proper sizing. The insole is marked/colored where the toes should be for a proper fit.
B004ZITJJQ Puma shoes My 5 year old son loves these shoes. As always, I order a size up. He wears a 12 and I ordered a 13. The 13 fits just fine.
B0054KWWQG Do not bother The package says sizes 10-13 maybe they are using metric system.  They are way to small for my size 11 feet and do not bother to wash them as they shrink to half there original size.  In closing I would say they are a total waste of money. Tried to give zero stars but could not
B005552422 GREAT GIFT! I purchased these shoes as a holiday gift for my husband. He loved them, I love them, but unfortunately they didn't fit.  He needed the one size they didn't order 12.5 - 13 was too big.
B0057DPSQG The sizing chart was nowhere close The quality of the items were quite good, but the sizing chart supplied to estimate was way wrong. The "large" size was way larger than the 36-38 estimate given. Should be looked at again.
B0057DPSQG sizes run WAY too big! I typically wear a Medium. Got a three pack of M's and they are way too baggy. Feel like an XXL.  I haven't been able to wear them so I can't comment on their durability.
B0058OR452 puma quality supperb purchased these for grandson who wears size 13 and has hard time finding socks for a size 13 foot! these are good quality and comfortable to wear. very happy with them.
B0058XE334 Extremely disappointed The shoe runs extremely small. I have never had an issue with Pumas. I normally wear a size 14 and my feet fit perfectly. I ordered a size 14 and it fit more like a 13 or even a 12.
B0058XF1V2 Nice sneakers, but way too small I wear a size 13 and that is what I ordered, the length was ok, but the width was way way too short.  They seemed like ballerina sneakers they were so tight and small width.  I'm sending them back immediately for my refund.
B0058XF6Q2 A Little Tight I received these a day ahead of schedule and wore them yesterday for the first time.  I wore them with the medium weight of socks that I would usually wear with sneakers.  By the end of the day my left foot was bothering me a little.  Granted, my left foot (13.5) is a little bigger than my right (12.5), but usually I can buy a size 14 and both feet are happy.  These were the first Pumas that I have owned and I must keep the sizing in mind if I order this brand again.The materials and workmanship seem average and time will tell if the quality is worthwhile.
B0058XFP86 Great sneakers This shoe is very comfortable and good looking. I wear a size 12 and had to exchange them for a size 13. It's very snug initially but within hours it conforms to your feet and becomes very comfortable. Buy it. You'll like them too.
B0058XFP86 Its a small i really like the color and the style however, the shoe feels like a size or two smaller than a 13
B0058XGI5A Don't buy unless you have freakishly narrow feet. It's hard to imagine anyone else that wears a size 13 could fit these shoes comfortably. Complete waste of money.
B0058XGI5A Pumas run a little small but I accounted for that. I normally wear a size 12 but in pumas I wear a 13.  I love these shoes.  Comfortable, and they look pretty awesome.  10/10 would buy again.
B0058XGLKC These are the lightest sneakers I've ever owned... ...and the lightness makes a huge difference. I'm normally a Nike guy, but that's mainly just because I buy what I know. I'd never owned Puma before, but honestly, if these things hold up to the rigor of being my shoes without falling to pieces(I'm really hard on shoes), I'll gladly make the switch for good.So far, I've played basketball and done some running/jogging in them, and I can't believe how much of a difference a lighter shoe makes.I wouldn't advise playing a whole lot of hoops in the Pumagility (that's not what they're made for, anyhow), just because the lightweight design means less cushioning against the effects of frequent jumping and landing. It wasn't a big deal, but I did notice the slightest bit of extra soreness the next day (I'm always sore after playing hoops, though). When running, however, the support and cushioning was just fine, and I had no noticeable effects from switching shoes.The appearance of the shoes took some getting used to, since Puma obviously has a different approach to aesthetics than Nike, but they look fine, and that's not really a huge deal for me anyway.The only factor left for me to consider is durability. Having only had them a month, I obviously can't speak to that. Generally, a pair of Nikes holds up for about a year before showing noticeable wear-and-tear. If these can last that long, I'll be sold.A note about sizing: I normally take a U.S. size 13, and I prefer 13-wide when I can get it. My Pumagilitys are size 14 D (D refers to the width, but I'm not sure where on the width-spectrum it falls) and they fit great, so my tentative advice to potential buyers is to consider buying large if you oscillate between sizes like I do (13-14).In brief, they're very comfortable shoes, the lightness makes a big difference in performance, and I'm very happy with them.
B0058XHEBM Little small I wear a size 13 but in a pinch I could go with a 12.  This sneaker, that is marked 13, seems smaller than any sneaker that I have ever owned.  there is no toe room and the sneaker itself is very narrow.  the quality of the sneaker very good.  The picture of the sneaker indicates a white puma logo on the tongue but the sneaker I received did not have this logo,  All in all the sneaker is OK but not great.
B0058XHEBM Just what I wanted. Brings back memories of old from past reviews i took a chance and went one size larger 13 to 14. good thing because they fit perfect. good looking as well.ken B.  rochdale,Ma.
B0058XHEBM So light , I feel like I'm floating.... These fit me perfectly and are a true size 14.....Many are shorter and closer to a size 13....Not these... A perfect fit and they feel so light and comfortable...I haven't worn Puma's in years but I'll begin wearing them again after this purchase...
B0058XHEBM Comfortable good looking shoes Pumas always run one side smaller than other brands.  I normally get a 12 and puma size 13 fits as expected.  These shoes are very comfortable.
B0058XI8BM Looks cool, Not great quality, Way too small The sizing is way off. Ordered a 12 which fit like a 10. Not Pumas best work. The construction wasn't great, loose stitching and inconsistent appearance.
B00591BYFK Lightweight and comfortable Bought these in a size 13 for daily wear.  Happy with the weight and fit.  I'm a longtime Puma customer and these are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn.
B00594CZLO Indeed Great Casual Shoe I ordered a size 13 and these were a tad bit loose because I actually wear 12.5 and shoe makers seem to have something against that size! So they are sized about perfect but I have ordered 2 other pairs of Pumas in size 13 the last few years and they fit me perfect...  Anyways I just wear 2 pairs of socks and the shoes fit perfect thankfully. They look like they have a Velcro strap but they are just slip-ons. I ordered the color Burnt Olive/Black Coffee and they were a little more green than in the picture. The Corduroy looks great.  Overall excellent deal for the price I paid(about $35) with free shipping from Amazon.
B00594DGMQ Sizes Run Small I bought a size 13 for my fiance` but his feet, I guess, were too big for their size 13. We ended up selling it.
B00595JOOY good looking shoe, 13 fits like a 12 Picked up a  brand new pair at a thrift store today, probably the cast off of someone who ordered them in their size but they didn't fit... like many others said this is sized way small but it's a beautifully made shoe.
B00595JOOY Awesome shoe, sized a little tight I listened to some of the reviewers saying that this shoe is way too tight, and I don't fully agree. I wear sizes 13 and 14, so I bought both colors in size 14. That was way too loose; my feet would slide around and move up and down in the shoes as I walked. Now I'm wearing size 13, having returned the 14's. Yes they feel a little tight at first, but they are all leather. During the first day of wear, these shoes started to feel very comfortable. Take into account that they fit narrow feet better, as all Pumas seem to do. Also take into account that leather stretches, and this is a slip-on, so if you buy a size up from normal, your shoes might be too loose after a few months of wear without much ability to adjust. Even the sole has possible stretch, since it is in two pieces with leather connecting them. If Puma made these in 13.5 I might have bought that, but 13 works out ok.Aside from fit, they look great in both colors and I have gotten multiple complements from people. It seems like the design was well thought out, and I hope they last for a while. I have bought Pumas for a years, and their shoes seem to hold up well.
B00595JOOY Puma Men's Vedano Leather Fashion Sneaker Really nice shoes. The size is a bit mis-leading, PUMAS typically run smaller than advertised. The UK sizes are the ones (in my opinion) that are closer to the acurate size. My shoe size is about a 14.5 in US sizes, that is a 13 to 13.5 in the UK. I can wear a US size 14 comfortably in other shoes, but not always in PUMA.
B00595JOOY WHAT size?! &#34;A little small&#34; is an understatement. I ordered a full size larger and could BARELY get my foot all the way in, yet the heel was loose. I normally wear a 13, and maybe Pumas don't have this problem in the smaller sizes, but these are RIDICULOUSLY narrow for a 14.
B005CK7W3Q Runs a bit small! I bought these sneakers in a 13.5 and my daughter actually where a 12.5 comfortably. I bought 13.5 with hopes of these tennis lasting a while but I don't think that will happen. She has a bit of room in them but not as much as I expected!These sneakers a are of a great material, they wipe clean with a damp cloth.
B005CKB0WA Nice little shoes but sizing is way off... The shoes are nice enough, so 4 stars. But it does take some trial and error to get the correct size. My daughter is a 11.5. I ordered the 12.5-way too small. We eventually found that the 13.5 was the right size for her. I would order up one and a half or two sizes larger than you normally would.
B005CKJWW0 Wrong size Very confortable sneakers for my daugther, and nice material too.But I bought a 1.5 youth size and I received a 13-13.5 size.
B005COYKXC Too small I like that these sneakers are very light. My daughter says they are comfortable too. But they run a size smaller. My daughter wears size 13. I ordered 13,5 and had to exchange to 1.
B005COYKXC runs a size small i am returning these daughter wears 12 ordered 12.5 and they just fit am going to order a 13. overall beautiful sneaker.
B005CVWYPG 13.5 is really size 13 The shoe is great, I just wish that they sent us the correct size 13.5 not 13. This is the second time purchasing Puma products for 13.5 and receiving size 13.
B005EVOPB0 Way too small! I love these shoes!  And I love the Puma brand.  I have four pairs of Puma running shoes, all size 6.5, but these shoes fit more like a size 5.5.  There's no size 7 available so I can't exchange them.  I'm very disappointed that Puma would not keep their sizing consistent.
B005HEL4W2 Nice shoes These are nice shoes and they look great.  Got them before a couple of outings and all I got was compliments.  I wear 12 EEE for dress shoes, ordered 13's and they are wide and big and comfortable.  These shoes run true to size, maybe even a little big.  They are comfortable and broke in within the first round (I was in a cart too).  The only thing I don't like is that they have Puma's spike system, so all the qlock spikes I have lying around are no good.
B005LCENV4 Way too small A pair of size 13 shoes and there is barely room for anything else. If you plan on taking a pair of shoes to the gym and nothing else, this bag might serve you well.
B005R531DG Best buy It was an excellent purchase, the exact size, nice price, prompt delivery and good material, my 13 year old daughter loves it, it is comfortable and very pretty.
B006J7WSEY My son loves them Age:5Size#13 (they size out small)They fit my son exactly as expected, he was more than excited about the shoes.  His first comment was about the color and his follow up was about how fast they will make him (remember he is 5). He is happy and so are we!
B006J7WSEY Sizing is way off Ridiculously small.  I had a size 1 in another style and the size 1.5 Puma was much smaller than the 1.
B006L87X0A good this is the best purchase I made so far they are great, good size and nice way to package them,
B006OEY2NC Great shoes Very comfortable, leather is soft and the spikeless soles are much more comfortable than traditional rubber spikes.  Shoes run just a hair small, so a size 13 fit me perfectly, as I am usually between a 12 /12-13.  Would recommend at the right price, Amazon had them on sale at $59
B006QOJ8PM SIck Kicks I really like my new PUMA's, i love PUMA to begin with, but these are really comfortable, and light. To top it all off they look great too! I will say that reading some other reviews I ordered a size larger (i'm usually a 13) just to be sure and I think I could have went with 13's, because the 14's feel like they are a size too big in the front.
B006QOJ8PM great shoes! I bought these shoes for my husband and I got them a 12, and he wears a 12.5 (I thought he wore a 12).  I had to return the shoes, which was fast and easy!  I exchanged them for a soze 13 that fit him perfect....they are sharp looking pumas.  And my hubby is picky when it comes to shoes.Abslolutely happy with everything!
B006QOJ8PM Possibly the most comfortable shoes I've ever had This was my first time buying Pumas, and I was expecting great things based on what I've heard . . . I was not disappointed. The soles feel amazing, and I was able to walk about ten miles during a trip the week I got them without the pain in my feet that I usually get from other brands. I will definitely buy Pumas again!Important Note: I am usually a size 13, but I read that when buying Pumas to always go one size larger. I found that this advice was incredibly accurate, and my size 14 Pumas fit my 13 feet almost perfectly.
B006QOJ8PM Great shoes - in the short term!!!  *UPDATED* I use these shoes for the gym.  I usually wear a 13 or a 14 (depending on the shoe).  In this case I would say they run true to size, but a little on the narrower side.  Therefore, I got the size 14 and they fit perfectly.  If you kinda fall in the middle of a size or have wider feet I would suggest ordering a size up.  However, they look good and seem pretty durable thus far.  They were worth the price I paid (it was a daily deal and was a great discount!).  I would probably still buy them at a higher price since they were good.UPDATE - After 4 weeks these shoes came apart from the inside and started poking the top of my foot incessantly.  I tried several things to fix the inside but I can't get the poorly stitched parts back together.  Now they are so uncomfortable I can't wear them at all and the return period has already passed.  DISAPPOINTED!
B006QOJ8PM fits like a 12 1/2 fits like 12 1/2 but that works great for me.  13's are always just a bit big and these feel great so im happy with my purchase.
B006QOJ8PM Need 13 1/2, do not have my size. needed a larger size but was not offered.  A s I usually wear a size 13, in some shoes its too small
B006QOJ8PM can't this item be replace? It's a larger 13 size, it's not comfortable for me. What can I do in this situation. Please I need a response.
B006QOJ8PM Awsome Hi very happy with my new pumas. I wish I bought 2 pairs of these.  They are a nice fit and very good design great product. I have a size 13 foot most sneakers are bigand bulky and I feel these make my feet seem smaller.
B006QOJ8PM Comfy shoes! I like these, I got them because they were a Gold Box Deal on Amazon and were cheap.  I was needing some new gym shoes.  They're really light and comfy!  I've worn them to the office two days now to check them out.  I ordered a size bigger after reading the reviews (usually a 13, got a 14), and they fit perfectly.  I have about an extra quarter inch or so in the toe.
B006QOJ8PM GREAT SHOES My son loved them , he was thrilled to find his size ( 14 ) . They are very comfortable.
B006QOJ8PM Great-looking shoes, but sizes run small. I absolutely love the style/design of these shoes! I'm elated about going to the Gym to work out ever since I got these. Beware, though. The shoes' sizes do run a little small, so order yours a size or so above what you really need. I ordered size 14 because my size 13's fit just fine and I didn't want to take a chance on these running a little small, and it's a good thing I did. The 14's fit just like my 13's do, if not a little tighter. They'll be fine for working out, though, since I don't wear them anywhere else but the Gym. I just may order more of these in different colors soon.
B006QQ0WYG Looks great, sizing is off though! The shoe looks great.  Unfortunately, I feel like Puma sizes shoes on the small side.  I've fit into 11 1/2 shoes before, and I ordered a pair of these in a size 12.  They were tight.. very tight.  Sent them back, apparently I'm a size 13 in 'Puma' sizes.  They're still a little narrow, but they're breaking in pretty well.  They look good but seem a little pointy too.
B006QQ1HZ4 Great Buy! I bought this shoe for $37...I could not pass it up. Usually this shoe runs in the $100 range bc of the Ferrari / Italy logos. I bought 14 bc there was a significant price difference between the 14 and 13. I normally wear 13 and the shoe ran small in my favor and fits really nice! The material of the midsole is really nice, I spilled some ice cream on them the first day and was able to clean them to shiny new.
B0071F2DOS The sizing is way off. I bought these in size 13 US. They are indeed marked and branded as size 13 US, but are nowhere near correct. They are a size 11 at most.Beware of the sizing when buying.
B00721G7RK very small I measured the size 13 against a size 12.5 shoe and the 12.5 shoe is slightly bigger than the 13 puma.
B0073IRJOW Sizing These are great shoes and I really like them a lot. As others have posted, the sizing is way off.  I am a size 12 and ordered a size 13 and they fit perfectly. If you do decide on these shoes, make sure you order a half to a full size larger.
B00795KALS Size 13 shoe They are slightly small for size 13 shoe, but I am used to that being the case and they still fit my foot fine.  I hate being on the end of the sock size cap.
B007J4B1QM Three Stars Shoe is too big. Think I need a 13!
B007JATLTK Sizing These are great shoes and I really like them. As others have posted the sizing is way off. I wear a size 12 and ordered a size 13 and they fit perfectly. If you buy these shoes make sure you order a half to a full size larger.
B007M6AH2Q outstanding fast shoe with great feel This is one great shoe. I am in my 40s and play soccer in the local league. I played with other good shoes over time, from Puma (V1.10, which I think it is one of the greatest shoes, too bad is not available anymore), Umbro, Nike, all of them leather as I like the classy feel of leather. Although I like my V1.10, these happily replace them. I believe the ball feel is even better with these, kangaroo leather makes them fit like a glove, they are very light and have good traction. I cannot speak of how they hold over time, but they seem to be well made. I got them for a bargain with these non-traditional colors, all worth it. Get them if you can and you won't regret it. I usually wear size 12 in most shoes, e.g. Adidas Copa Mundial, but these run a bit small and size 13 fits great. Other reviews indicated they are true to size, but in my experience, at least the larger sizes, e.g., 13, seem to run a bit small.
B007M6B9A0 Returned because the size did not match I generally wear US 14 and I was hoping to get that but this shoe's US 14 is too small for me. Had to return it.
B007MAYD2C toooooo small i dont understand why is it too small. i ordered size 13 and didnt fit my 6 years old daughter at all . it was too tight ! i am truly disappointed .
B007PK5T0Y puma shoes Wasn't sure about these, but glad I ordered them.  The are more beautiful in person.  I love pumas, but usually don't love the price. For $13.99, I couldn't resist.
B007UM6PAK Bad size I order the prodct size 14 and you send to me size 13, and now i don't have way to chage it because am far away
B007WQHB2K runs very small I purchased a size 14 and they are smaller than my brothers size 13 adidas. The cleat pattern is nice and they would work great for turf but they are just too small.
B008A77PNA Run small I could barely get my foot in. Way to small.  Someone wrote that they run big so I bought my actual size 11 1/2 when 95% of the time I buy 12's. I should have ordered 13's.
B008AJ4JR8 Small for size I love the look but I'm kind of disappointed in the sizing on these. I usually wear a 12 but lord was it both short and tight. I then ordered a 13 and while the length is better they are still tight around the toes. Not sure if I'll be keeping them. I recommend other people order a size bigger based on my experience.Also, the material is very interesting. The outer top portion of the shoe feels like rubber but does flex more like a suede. Not sure how well it'll last over time. I kind of have the feeling it could start cracking where the toe flexes.
B008AJ4JR8 Really is small. But I rode in comments that is small. So my size foot is 13 I bought 14. Was good for me.
B008ALWBFS Tight I wear a size 13 and ordered a size 14 and it is still very tight. Not sure I can play soccer in this unless it expands. Otherwise I would give it out. Disappointed.
B008ALWDZG Great boots! I usually wear between 12 1/2 and 13. These size 13's were perfect. Durable and good looking. I'd buy these again.
B008ALX6SO runs small shoes are nice, but run small. plus me beeing a size 12, there is no 12.5 offered. next size is 13, which is too big..
B008AWU21W good look.... how many black shoes with white soles can one own? well it turns out i have about 10! lol these make me happy everytime i put them on. great construction. great comfort and they look fantastic. my only gripe is, they run SUPER LARGE! i usually wear 13-14 and these feel like 15s on my feet. next time, im getting a size 13.
B008AXTOQ0 No Half Sizes Above 12- What Are They Thinking? Cool looking shoe with plenty of cushioning, however, Puma does not offer half sizes in a lot of their shoes(Voltaic 4 included), above size 12. So I ordered the PUMA Men's Voltaic 4 in both size 12 & 13. The 12's were too small & the 13's were way too big/long. The enormous disparity between the two sizes, considering they don't produce half sizes above 12, is pretty ridiculous.So apparently there is a decent chunk of the population(size 12.5, size 13.5) that cannot use Puma running shoes. Can't GIVE them my money- I tried.. I tried..
B008AXTOQ0 Great product Especial shoes for running or cross training.  Great color, comfortable, normally I'm 12 in puma it's 13 one size more
B008AXTOQ0 heavy I wear a 13 in just about every brand tennis shoe out there. These fit more like a 14. Sold as a running shoe, way to heavy to run in.
B008AXTOQ0 WAY too thin I usually wear size 13 shoes but I read that these shoes run a little small so I ordered size 14 instead. I have never ordered extra wide shoes in the past, the norm usually fits just fine. I get the shoe and I wouldn't have been able to force it on with Vaseline and 10 bodybuilders pushing and pulling. I cannot believe how thin this shoe was. It was a bit longer than I would have liked, as expected because I ordered a size bigger, but I don't know how could possibly fit this shoe on their foot. I give it 2 stars because it was a good looking shoe, but I had to return it for a refund.
B008AXTOQ0 Very comfortable shoes I love Puma shoes and sports wear.  I brought these shoes because of the price.  I also, for some reason really like grey running shoes.  I wear a size 13 and the size 13 that I ordered fit me perfect.  They look great on my feet but the one thing I would change is the color of the shoe strings.  The shoe strings color should either be light or dark grey.  For the price, I think the shoes are a good deal.
B008AXY38Y Three Stars Wish I could trade for a 13
B008AXY38Y Please make half sizes. They are a half size to big and I had to get a 13 because their is not a 12.5 but they are very comfortable. .
B008AZLCBI Tiny Feels like a 9.5 not 11.5  Have to return them and get a bigger size maybe 12.5-13.  Like the color and style
B008B0MGQ2 didnt receive my order of: PUMA Men's Super Elevate 2 Running Shoe,White/Twilight Blue,13 D USSold by: Amazon.com LLCCondition: New- 1 item Gift options:- Gift-wrap: None- Gift note: run yaddy for kaye$65.00i didnt receive my shoes and there was no refund im not understand this please help me thanks
B008EXQTBO cool shoes for a great pirce The larger your feet the better chance you will need to go one size up.  I normally wear 13 and I got 14 and they were perfect.  Other reviews have suggested a 1/2 size larger but I had to use one size up.  Cool looking comfortable shoes.
B008F17R2K Sizing is way off. I wear a size 13 shoe and a 13-14 sneaker.I ordered a 14, but it is way too small for me, feels like a 12.5 or 13 at best.Keep this in mind when ordering the Puma.
B008F17R2K size is VERY incorrect I bought 2 different pair of puma shoes at the same time , and both pair run very small. II am 40 yrs old and have had a size 14 shoe since I was I was 17. I always grab a pair of 14 and a lot of the time I don't try them on cause I know my size. I am very disappointed in this product . not only because these were going to be a Christmas present that my daughter was going to give me , but I know have to ship the items back. I would suggest that if you want a pair of puma shoes get a size larger
B008F17R2K puma bioweb Puma bioweb elite was an ultra light shoe. Unfortunately these shoes run really small. I normally wear a 12.5 i ordered a 13. The shoes fit like a 12. which was a bummer. It was a great price for some ultra light weight cross trainers. You just gotta get  the right size.
B008F17R2K Incredibly undersized... Have worn an 11 medium my entire life...no matter the shoe.  These were still way too small even one size up, to a 12.  Further, the medium width was ridiculously narrow.  Then, upon further inspection, the construction was shoddy and i bet they wouldnt hold up to any kind of hard workout.  There's a lot better out there.
B008F17R2K beast the shoe itself is very light and it feels awesome i got size 13 it is a bit small for my taste but performs well. it looks menacing!
B008F17R2K too small their sizing is off--they are not correctly sized way too tight for the sizeI don't know what else to say.
B008F17R2K Great Product But Fits Very Small! Just a beautiful shoe and great price on deal but the largest size (14D) did not fit and I usually run a 13.5 to 14. :-(
B008F17R2K Good Deal, Runs Small The shoes look great but fit a bit small. I own several other pairs of Puma's and always have worn a 12 however with these I would have gone with a 13 for the extra space. I did order another color in the 13 so if those fit better I'll probably go ahead and return them for the bigger size.
B008L74P0A Like the look I like the look of this sneaker and they fit well too. I do have wide feet and had to go with a larger size (I got the size 13, but I wear a 12 if they have a wide width) to have the shoes be comfortable.Given the latest style of sneakers is to be very colorful, it was nice to find a &#34;plain&#34; sneaker to wear.
B008QY0MWS Hit or miss Purchases these shoes for my father after buying the same pair for my self a few weeks back.  I wear a size 13 and they fit me perfectly, extremely confortable and durable as well as stylish and effective.  Unfortunately my father who wears a 10.5 said they were way to snug, hopefully they will be easy to exchange for a larger size
B008RB3J48 Amazing shoe, way too small!!! This shoes are super cool, look to be of good quality but are way too small for me. I wear a 12 in every shoe/sneaker. Puma clothing fits me perfect. These however feel like they might be an 11 or even a 10 1/2. They are labeled a US 12. As I said every shoe I own is a 12, except some dress shoes/boots I wear 11s. Sadly the size 13 available from another seller was over double the price and I can't find them elsewhere.... I was going to return them but it was $15 to return as it was not an amazon prime item. So I will keep them a bit and sell them myself on eBay or to a friend. On a final note the shoes arrived in a beat up box, and there were some slight creases in the shoe, which made me think someone else tried them and returned them for not fitting, several other reviews shared my opinion that the shoe was awesome, but way too small. So, hopefully these cool shoes fit someone out there!
B0098ICQPM Puma suede sneaker Cool shoes.  My favorite color.  I usually wear a 14 in Adidas, but these in size 13 fit close enough.
B009FD2LM8 The Pumas went back . . . I am a 13.but Pumas are just small and I have to go with14. and that will fit me exactly.
B009FDR416 Great shoes, runs short This is a great pair of shoes, not only good looking and stylish but also feels comfortable.They do run short so make sure you order 1 size bigger than what you are.I would highly recommend it or will buy another pair if they would have 13 size if blue style would be available.
B009GZS6OW Good shoes, order a size up. I usually wear a size 12, but I had to move up to a 13 at the behest of the comments, other than that these shoes are fairly flawless in the first week that I've had them. They fit my wider feet and I've been nothing but pleased with the comfort. I did play a pickup game of soccer in them, and they held up well and were very comfortable. All in all, aside from being a tad long on the end, these shoes are very good.
B009MNYG1U Great look Great looking shoe with 2 different  lace options.  I typically wear size 12 or 13 depending on the shoe. I wear size 13 in Puma. These fit perfectly. I like that most of the sole is a different color than white so they won't look dirty so soon.
B009O0T7FQ great feel but too small these socks are supposed to be size 10-13 but in reality they are not much than 10-11 i suspect. i am 12.5 and the sock barely cover my ankle.
B009STI9NO to big Great shoe and smooth buying process, but the 13 was bigger than other size 13 pumas I have. Easy to return too though
B009STNEF2 Hideously Ugly and Too Big I made the mistake of reading the reviews too carefully. Several recommended buying a size up when these were way too big. Aside from that, they were just plain ugly. Mistaken purchase. I'll keep trying (:
B00AAKNJXU athletic shorts inseam is a little shorter than expected & fit is slim.  Daughter wears 12-14 & the size 14 was too tight for us to keep.
B00AOD8YMO 13 year old sized 13 shoes These were a good buy for my 13 year old son, he is very happy with them and they fit him well.
B00AODVKJI Kingsley Sneaker look nice but 13 A bit small can wear for looks but not running in them . 13.5 -14 if u wear size 13 !!!!!!! A C- Grade!!!
B00AONURJ2 Classic, fashionable look Looks great, very fashionable. It looks as depicted the photos. I wear a size 13 and they run true to size. I can't wait to wear these out!
B00AONVA52 Comfortable Shoe I ordered these for my husband.  He is a size 14 to 15 and I could only find these in a 14.  They worked for him, are easy to slip on and very comfortable.
B00AONVA52 Sizing is wrong Way, way to small
B00AONW9JS sizes run very small Never owned a pair of Pumas before so I was unaware they ran as small as they do...The 14 fit like a 12/13. Hopefully this will help anyone else looking to purchase a pair. The shoe itself is of nice quality just way too small
B00AONW9JS Great sneakers They were too small, so I returned them and got an exchange for a size 13. perfect fit.  thank you.  Great Seller, i recommend to everyone.
B00AONW9JS Size 13 too tight My usual shoe size is 13. This size 13 is too tight. Still use when cycling but can't walk long with them on.
B00AONWIC6 Gift for my Son My son really likes the fit and finish! He seems quite happy. I took a chance and ordered 1 size larger( thanks to other reviewers!) and I`m told they fit great( from a size 13 to a 14). Pumas have always been one of the best!
B00AOOH730 If the shoe fits . . . I just received these shoes, so this is a very superficial review at this point. They look great, fit well, are comfortable, and seem to be well constructed. My experience with the Puma brand is that they tend to run maybe a half size small and somewhat narrow, and since I wear a 12 and size 12.5 is not available, I tried a 13. They fit perfectly with an additional insole & orthotics. So far I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend these shoes.
B00AORBTZY great shoes and fast shipping I would recomend this to anyone who likes light shoes. They are so nice and confortable but one thing, they run small so make sure you get half size up, I weear 12.5 on Nike tiempo and 13 on this puma.
B00AOREMJ4 Way Too Small!!! I wear a mens size 9 1/2 in almost every shoe I have worn as an adult.  These cleats run way too small, I finally had to get a size 11 to get this shoe to fit comfortably.  I would order a size 1 1/2 to 2 sizes larger in this style of Puma.
B00ASRJFA6 Filnaly I'm 13 us shoe size, and all my socks have holes on the toes because they are not rely universal size, these ones are conformable and looks perfect for persons who were 13 and more
B00B500BLW nice indoor shoe nice shoe my daughter wears a size 13 sneaker mens size 13 Puma indoor soccer shoes fit her very well
B00B5013PK Sizing is 2 sizes off Since we have already return them twice I'm going to keep them although I don't think there going to fit for much longer.The sizing is no where close to what a shoe sizing machine says
B00B5HUIO0 Wrong error It was a wrong purchase as it is for an adult and not a child, the shoe is too small I need a size 13 adult
B00B5HUIO0 Great kicks but definitely run small These are great sneakers. However, they definitely run small. I had ordered a size 12 which is the current size my son wears. I had to send them back & get a size 13. Those fit like the 12 should fit.
B00B6QO3O6 good product These socks are made well and last better than any I have bought before.  They are slightly tight for an extended size, but just right for me since I am size 13 shoe.
B00B7LUG00 perfect once again! Picked these up for a good price and couldn't be happier. I'm a size 13 and they fit like a glove. My love for Puma shoes continues to grow. :)
B00B7LUYFC Puma's never dissapoint! I wear a 13 shoe and their 13's are always the same fit no matter what model I get. That is perfect when you order online and fear if it will fit or not :)
B00B9ZDQA6 Great shoe! Tight fit, though I love this shoe- very light, comfortable, and stylish. However, like other Puma shoes, I found it to be tight. I normally wear a 12, but I had to return a pair and replace them with a size 13 for these.
B00BAZGA8A Very cute!! Super cute, comfortable... It was actually small for my daughter but my friend ended up buying from me for her daughter and I reordered a bigger size (13 instead of 11.5). Very satisfied with the quality.
B00BYKA6OA Four Stars Comfortable, nice padding, breathable and best of all they fit my size 13 feet!
B00C6AIR2U Not the same size I ordered Clearly,  I ordered a size 13, taking into account the slim fit of most puma shoes. I have size 12 feet wide, so naturally I would try size 13. The shoes sent to me were exactly size 12 and so wearing these shoes is somewhat uncomfortable, similar to wearing two pairs of thick socks with a fitted shoe. I don't think I can return it anymore since I have thrown away the box it came in, so goodbye $40.
B00C6BPP10 Order at least a size up. Nice looking comfortable shoe.First pair way too small.  The size I order in every other shoe/boot I own, I couldn't get my foot in.Ordered a size up to a 13 and it fit better.  Felt a little narrow still, but much more accurate.
B00C6BPP10 nice looking shoes unfortunately they do not fit me. I wear a size 13 in shoes normally but the fact that these are medium width might be the reason and I will return them
B00C6BPP10 I've only worn a couple times I wear size 12 in dress shoes but ordered a size 13 as I heard these run small. The size 13 is almost a perfect fit just a tiny bit bigger than my dress shoes. So far the shoes are comfortable as for durability, I haven't worn them enough to tell.
B00C6BTJUS Looking sharp! The shoes look nice, although I bought black shoelaces to go with it, the gray shoelaces make them look like sport sneakers.  Also they are a little large, but not too bad, I wear a size 13 and they are slightly larger than Nike size 13.
B00CAX73IW Not good at all for the price I am not big on reviewing anything, but these socks were bad enough for me to be compelled to comment.  I wear size 13, the top of the size range for these socks, but I like socks to be tight.  These seemed like they were about 3 sizes too big.  They were thin, and the socks were so loose they pretty much fell off my feet when I walked in stocking feet, much less with shoes on.  For how much these socks cost, they are horrible.  I strongly recommend against buying them.
B00CN5BWTI Way way to small The sizing on this runs way way to small! My daughter wears a 6 which is usually a little big on her, ordered the 6 and the pants are hight waters on her and the sleeves to short! Would never order this again.
B00DFPC6Z4 love em These socks are perfect.  I wear a size 12 or 13, depending on the shoe, and these socks fit perfectly!  They aren't too tight and definitely not too loose...would recommend if you like comfortable socks that are a little bit thicker than Hanes or FOTL.
B00DGOYGWA It's okay for the price. I ordered a 24 month size as a gift for me niece who is 13 months old. I was expecting it to fit her in the spring, but my sister tried it on her, and it fits now. Besides for the sizing, the outfit is super cute and my niece loves it.
B00DHJT5PC Painful to say, but this shoe didn't work for me I currently own 6 pairs of Puma shoes, and have had many in the past. This was my first Puma golf shoe. The fit is totally off. All of my others have been a size 13. The 13 in these was way too big. After I exchanged them for the 12, those were way too small. Besides the crazy sizing, the toe seems rather narrow compared to other golf shoes that I have owned. This may have been what was throwing the size off. Other than those two things, the shoe looks nice. I have always worn Footjoys on the course, and it looks like I am going to be sticking with them.
B00DNO1TXC Bit smaller Smaller than other similar Puma size 14
B00DOFY482 ORDER ONE SIZE UP I'm usually a 12D but I ordered 13.  I love these sandals and they fit great.
B00DOFY482 Size 13 is a small size 13 Nice design but the size 13 is not the size 13 european (46) i know now puma should be size 13.5 or 14 usa size for men in the futureits a pity for the rest i feels nice
B00DOG4R2Y This style has unique sizing This shoe is a weird fit. Recommended that you buy them in store. Their strange shape makes them hard to get the right size. 13's were big 12's were small... Good luck with these shoes.
B00DOG55AW Great look fit is too small.  Order one size larger. I love the look of these Pumas.  Once you get the correct fit, it is light and comfortable.  I believe customers need to be told how tight the fit is.  i wear a size 12 and had to return it right away since it did not even go on my feet.  I re ordered size 13 and honestly it is almost still too small.  i kept the size 13 pair since i love the look so much.  Just make sure you get one size larger when you order them.
B00DOJIJMA Way too small. I normally wear a 13 wide.  I have been able to wear Puma Salsa indoor shoes in a size 14 and they are very comfortable.  I bought these in a size 14 and couldn't even put my foot all the way in.  Since these are not leather and basically plastic there is no chance of them stretching at all.
B00DOJMB6U This new Puma soccer shoes are awesome!!!! If you are men size 12 like me, you need to purchase one sizer bigger 13.  I knew it from before, so I order it correct.  These shoes are beautiful and confortable!
B00DUK751E If ordered 13.5 you'll get size 13 We ordered 13.5 but got 13; it looks great, but has slippery type strings that are hard for a 6- yr old to tie.
B00DULYICC VERY nice shoes !!!! They are perfect weight do not have the only problem is that they are very small the size my son is 12 probably  he need 13
B00EDOMUYI Too tiny This product is more narrow at the toes and doesn't fit as well as previous Voltaic designs. I'm a size 13 so don't have choice to go up a half size cause they don't make a 13.5
B00EDOMUYI Sizing The only problem was the sizing. All other tennis  shoes I have bought in the same size and were great.
B00EDOMUYI nice and comfortable When I viewed the shoe online it looked nice but when I opened the box it looked even better. I normally wear a size 12 but I wanted them so bad that I got a size 13 but the 12 were all out. Best decision I made because these shoes run small I love these shoes they look and feel great and also very comfortable.
B00FWVH90G Sizing is way off Ordered these in a boy's medium. They are ENORMOUS. No way they could fit any 10 year old. The label says boys but I am convinced they must be a men's size.
