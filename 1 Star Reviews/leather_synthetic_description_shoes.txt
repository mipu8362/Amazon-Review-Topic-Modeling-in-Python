B00009PPHY Fit is GREAT Leather is Hard I love Puma boots and have been wearing them for years.  I usually buy kangaroo skin, but those only last me for a season or two (I play 3 times a week). So I thought I would try good old fashion leather.  The fit is still GREAT, no blisters at all.  But the leather is a bit hard and I can feel it with my touch.  I am sure it will get better over time and perhaps the hard leather will help these boots last more than 6-9 months for me!
B000BOCNRI good purchase No, wonder why great players such as pele and maradona wore these shoes, the k leather, helps with your touch. Relitivaly light for an all leather shoe and fits greats for people with wide feet
B000FSD0G8 Puma soccer player The shoe is an excellent fit and is obviously of high quality. However the leather is not as soft as I expected. I have a pair of Puma King Exec FG and leather is very soft and pliable. This is the reason that I purchased the Puma King Exec TT. The feel of the leather on the Puma King Exec TT is a disappointment, it is not as soft as expected. Hence three (3) stars instead of five (5)
B000R4XHRC doesn't match. the left shoe has a different type of upper front leather compared to right shoe!....it is too soft, and wrinkled.i also bought a 2nd pair for my son and both are made with identical leather material, not soft and wrinkled.no chance of returning it, already had them shipped here in the Philippines. :(
B000R4XHRC Good look, cheap leather... I'd like these in suede (remember the California?) or in nicer leather. They'll work though. I would buy them again.
B000UCUR3S nice shoes, wrong description the shoes are stylish, fit very well and have an air pump, however the description is lying by saying "upper leather" it is synthetic material, which doesn't justify the price, other than that these are probably the best tennis shoes I've had in a long time.
B001B52SDK Nice shoes I just pulled them out of the box and tried them on. The size is perfect, and the shoes look just like in the picture. They feel pretty comfortable and relatively durable. The one thing to note is that the upper is made with LEATHER in addition to textile, in case that is a concern for you. It was for me, because leather was not mentioned in the online product description.. but I like the shoes so I'm not going to bother returning them.
B001VKXF6Y Squeek strong, lasting and supportive shoe. a bit of a squeek when walking (from the leather) but not a big deal.
B002C4KCUA stink! Too much plastic, not enough leather... within one wearing these shoes are junk.  Such a pity, they look and feel great.  I can't get the smell out.  I have never encountered this with quality shoes.
B002C4KG60 Love these, but the leather is thin I love these shoes very much, but the only problem is that the leather veneer on the upper is very thin and has peeled off in spots which looks pretty terrible. My advice to puma, use better materials but keep up the stellar styling.
B002KAOLGC wrong description Leather ?I did not see leather. No leather. Only plastic, textile and rubber.Traces of glue on the surfacewrong description
B002KAOLGC suck This shoes look cool but one thing I hate about this shoes is that on the tip top of the shoe leather is so fragile it bands so easy I can cut that part with a knife I was expecting a hard tip top leather I will never buy this type of ugly shoes :/
B002KAOLGC Puma Leather Sneakers Nice quality, very good price, just as described. These shoes are very comfortable. Will purchase another pair to have as a backup.
B003EE49MY Cheap leather They look ok .. There was a  yellow stain on them  i didn't like it it's look like a spill on them cheap leather
B003EEBFI0 These are NOT leather shoes! The item description says "leather", but the top is made of synthetic materials that look like leather but are not. These shoes are also hard and do not look like the Puma quality I got to expect. The colors look nice and cheerful - but so far this is the only positive impression. Also, while most manufacturers post the info about used materials, I noticed that Puma started to avoid any reference to "man-made materials" in their synthetic shoes. This is a second pair I bought for my son that was marked "leather", while it was not. Other Puma shoes had clear "genuine leather" markings on the package. I wish there was a true detailed description or even package image on the Amazon website.
B003EED4XE Shoe is not leather as detailed in discription The detail states that these shoes are leather and they are not.  The description in the shoe states "Other Materials", Synthetic
B003ES3ZWA Cute, Comfy, and soft leather These are so comfortable. The leather is so soft I can touch them all day long. Shoes are very comfortable and definitely the name JAZZ is the best name for these shoes. The metallic color is so pretty. The rubber bottom is very low and shoes probably won't last long but it's definitely worth purchasing these shoes.
B003MAJWCW Despite the name--It's NOT leather I don't wear synthetic leather, so I was disappointed to see the ingredient label said the upper was synthetic.  I ordered the 9.5 because it was considerably cheaper than my usual size, and was very surprised to find that they fit.  This shoe runs very small.
B004GB11O8 disappointed I had a pair of these back in the 80s and, like a fool, I thought they would be the same. Not so, the new L2 has a thinner sole, which I don't mind, the main sticking point is the materials. The originals had a nubuck leather front and the rest was regular leather, the new ones are all manmade except for the little bit around the lace holes which has to be leather or the laces would just rip through the cheaper material (plastic), and it also gives puma the chance to call them "leather and manmade uppers". I always thought that these were a brilliant looking trainers, and they still are, they're just being made really cheaply.
B004GB11Z2 Great look! White leather.  No shoelaces. Simple design.*Shoes too flat.  Feet hurt after just 15min walk.*Heavy.*Hard leather. Don't recommend long walks until broken in.
B004GB12ME Awful. Why plastic? WHY, PUMA? I had to return these, sadly. The size marked is way too small, and I ordered in a size 12, thinking it would be true to size. I normally wear a 12. You need a 13 if you are going to buy these, because they are SYNTHETIC. Synthetic (plastic)  materials, unlike the leather they have replaced, do not stretch. They don't last, either. I would only buy these again if I could find them in leather.
B004GB13ZK Shoe is NOT leather upper as advertised. Smells like plastic! After waiting two weeks for delivery I am very disappointed with this shoe. The tag inside the shoe says Upper: leather AND MAN MADE MATERIAL. These are not leather shoes. They look synthetic; they feel synthetic and they smell synthetic. The uppers lack any type of flexibility you'd expect in a leather shoe. What's more is that the shoe stinks. It smells like plastic and vinyl just like a cheap shoe you can find at Payless Shoes. Anyone who has worn a synthetic athletic shoe knows that over time these shoes smell absolutely horrendous because man made material does not breathe like leather. Overall, I am very disappointed. If the Amazon  listing were correctly labeled I would never have bought these shoes. I am sending these back for a refund.
B004GEATZ2 Not Leather as advertised I can't believe amazon lists these as leather shoes. They are not. The fake suede purple looks very cheap as does the white vinyl.In my opinion $40 overpriced. I wouldn't pay over $20 for such low quality shoes.My daughter has a pair from Piperlime that were Cabana Racers as well, but they were real leather (and less expensive!) - I was hoping for the same good quality shoes, but these are very cheaply made. I live internationally and had to have a friend bring these to me from the States, otherwise I would send these back.Don't waste your money here.AMAZON! YOU SHOULD REMOVE THIS FALSE INFORMATION ASAP.
B004GNQIOE Very comfortable Great sneakers. Really comfortable. I use them for walking. Material is not leather but synthetic. I bought these to be my winter sneakers.
B004J4X4TW synthetic leather Do not buy this, this shoes will not last more then 2-3 games. so do not buy this!I'm really disappointed in this.
B004K00GLE Soccer cleats It feels and look great.  My shots were not affected at all.  I wish the top was leather instead of plastic.
B004K00GTG comfortable but color flakes off... The shoes are comfortable but the blue leather/synthetic leather, began flaking off the toe area within the first few weeks of use.
B004SGU4VM Perfect Looks really great and it is 100% leather. I got many compliments on these, so I would rate it as a great buy.
B004ZBHIVE Leather Comfortable shoes and nice. Only the label leather notes and I do not think. The rest can buy with confidence.
B004ZIPVH0 Cleats I like them -- I would prefer leather over synthetic though. They hide the laces very well and is a great looking boot.
B0050U20TY MISLEADING DESCRIPTION -- DO NOT BUY In the detailed description of the product it is mentioned that the upper is made of synthetic leather, but in the brief description it simply says "leather", which is totally misleading. I am not supposed to read the detailed description to find out that the word "leather" mentioned in the brief description means "synthetic leather".Note that the labels inside the shoes clearly indicate that the upper is synthetic, so it seems that Amazon has posted misleading information on its web-site on purpose.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU DO NOT INTEND TO BUY SHOES WITH SYNTHETIC UPPER!!!
B0050U3W32 NOT LEATHER AS STATED IN THE DESCRIPTION! This was a disappointment as this item was described as leather and is NOT.  It is all manmade according to the information on the product!
B0058XE0GY Classic leather white sport shoes , i like it Classic leather white soprt shoes , i like it .My friends like it too .few see the style on the street
B0058XE334 AWEFUL Its not leather.its ugly and the shoe had a hole when it arrived to me.I would have rate it 0 star if possible.
B0058XF1V2 Quality It looked good on the picture but when i got it, I was very disappointed it was not leather is was plastic looking material.
B0058XF1V2 1 number bigger is enough.... average shoes....not leather....1 number bigger is enough....good quality but not over the expectations ....5 stars is the VEDANO LEATHER ! VEDANO is the best ever seen...
B0058XF1V2 great very comfortable . I order this pairof shoes half size than I am, and comfortable, great looking .look nice! buy them love the leather.
B0058XFYDC NOT A SHOE LEATHER AS OFFERING Great disappointment in the description of the shoes, says that the material is leather, or at least suggest that, but it is not, are plastic shoes that has nothing to do with a leather shoe, should report either on the material, even in the same shoe comes the description of the shoe is supposedly leather, iS A LIE
B0058XFYDC Comfortable and stylish; Poor construction & material These sneakers are definitely better looking than most (especially you wear running shoes as casual shoes...which is an atrocity). They are very comfortable and fairly true-to-fit depending on the color (oddly enough).I have own about 4 pairs of Clydes and they all have one problem in common: the soles. The soles wear out in about 2 months after regular wear and ANY moisture will get into the shoe from the bottom. They aren't meant to be waterproof, but even walking on wet ground will soak the shoes after regular wearing of the shoe.Additionally, if you buy the "leather" be aware that it is not genuine leather (even though it claims to be "real" leather). It feels like faux leather and does not absorb leather conditioners or waterproofing agents the way full grain or even cheap leather does. At the price of the shoes, this was to be expected.With proper care and light use, these shoes last maybe 6 months. I still love the comfort and looks of the shoe (and price) so I keep buying these, but I really wish they were better quality.
B0058XHEBM Tis truly all leather Size is true, however they are leather, so a little tight. Not like the whirlwhinds at all. Bought them for one outfit and they go well with them, just not anything else.
B0058XHEBM Puma I had one years ago and the leather was a lot better than this new one. Otherwise, fine. Leather was somewhat fake.
B0058XHEBM for the price Not leather. for the price i paid for 4 pairs of leather each. i will return. i cant see myself paying 55.00 for plastic name brand sneaker.
B0058XHEBM Not leather Like several others, I was very upset and disappointed that these shoes are in fact not leather! The item title AND description both say leather upper, but when you get the shoe, it is not leather.
B0058XHEBM Cheap non-leather shoes Thought these would be like my previous leather white and blue Roma shoes but the all black version is just a cheap synthetic/vinyl version. The Puma logo tag on the tongue is also all black, not black and white as pictured.While they are a comfortable shoe I feel miss-led by the description. Not sure if this is entirely Amazon's fault as the Puma.com site has the same description. Anyway beware of the &#34;leather&#34;.
B0058XHEBM No Leather I could not find any leather in this sneakers, I'm very dissapointed,it is written here about this product that upper is leather made, but it is not,it is made of "other material".
B0058XHEBM Geninune leather ? Actually I bought it for my husband . The size fits as expected but he has dought about it is real leather or not would you confirm this issue ? Thanks!
B0058XHEBM UTB terribly artificial leather shoes UTB terribly artificial leather shoes, one size smaller, odor and sweat is guaranteed, do not buy! shame! it will be impossible to wear shoes for those who do not respect Ceiba, even give free shame, never buy Puma!
B0058XHEBM Good looking shoes but very narrow, and not leather I like the look of Puma shoes, always have, but I guess having marginally wider feet than normal (I presume), I am just not going to be able to find a pair of Puma sneakers that I can buy without care. This shoe for example is extremely narrow, I even purchased a 9.5D instead of my usual 9D after reading some of the reviews, and taking into account my previous experience with puma shoes, but my goodness, these are the narrowest shoes at this size I believe I have ever seen. I also want to point out that these are advertised as leather, but they sure do not feel or smell like new leather, and I think the label inside the shoe stating the uppers are &#34;Other Materials, Synthetique&#34; pretty much proves the point. Overall the purchase was obviously a disappointment, though the Amazon return process was as flawless as ever, and NO, I am not trying the 10D.
B0058XHEBM These are NOT LEATHER shoes I was specifically interested in the Romas because they had a &#34;leather upper for long wear and serious style&#34;.  I ordered the shoes, on sale, from a participating Amazon vendor. My order was shipped and delivered as expected, but when I unwrapped the shoes, they had no leather... anywhere...  and the manufacturer's stickers stated &#34;other materials&#34;.  I called Puma directly and was told that their shoes (as stated on their site) were made of leather and I should try to return them to Amazon for a leather pair.  I did so, thinking maybe a pair directly sourced from Amazon would be leather, as advertised.  I paid full price for the second pair of Romas (Black/NightShade/Orange... not my first color choice, but sourced and shipped directly from Amazon) and they were not leather either.  Very frustrated I called Puma again, and this time was told that the shoes on their site were only leather if they said &#34;Genuine Leather&#34;!  Are you kidding me...?!?!  Talk about advertising that does not accurately represent the product.  Its great if you want to make animal friendly products, but call it what it is... synthetic!  DO NOT ORDER THESE IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT A LEATHER SHOE, YOU WILL RECEIVE &#34;OTHER MATERIAL&#34; SNEAKERS.
B0058XKUMM False marketing The one reviewer who said that these Puma Roma shoes are not leather was correct.  The description on the label in the shoes states that the upper is made of "other materials+leather".  That is because only the toe and heel suede parts are leather.  The rest of the upper is not.  This is false marketing.  The shoe is obviously a cheap shoe to make, being synthetic,  and the synthetic material that constitutes 80% of the upper is a type that I believe will easily pick up dirt, and be impossible to clean well.  Therefore, I am returning it.
B00595JOOY love my new leather Pumas beautiful pair of sneakers.delivery on time.very comfortable.all very satisfying.the shoes have a very attractive line and the leather is strong and looks heavywear.
B00595JOOY classy and cool Great sneakers with fine leather finish.Got the white version,its easy to get them dirty but that's the case with any white shoes.Very satisfied so far.The leather will get loose and they will fit perfectly.
B005CPBU2K Good leather soccer shoe Received the shoes on Sunday and my boy went to play outside with them immediately.  I purchased these shoes for my boy after having some problems with my shoes. I had done extensive research on comfortable soccer shoes / cleats for men & boys (The other parameters such as touching / feel of the ball, look / design of the shoe were secondary). Leather vs synthetic was considered and decided to purchase this model. Being brand new, out of the box, my boy played two hours and he stated they were great. Being a coach I asked him how he felt the ball, comfort, grip on the artificial surface, he stated that they are better then his previous Adidas model. The leather is relatively soft, good feel on the ball, passing and shooting. I shall be looking to buying this model again when they rip or become small on him as long as they last more then three four months of soccer.
B005I6YAU2 ! It is a PUMA. Need I stay more? No really, the kangaroo leather is seriously great. I really appreciate it.
B005R506IO Didn't get exactly what was offered When I purshased this product, in the specifications it said it was leather; nontheless, the shoe is made of rubber, textile and 'other materials'... leather is not mentioned.
B006J7WSEY Seems like aq good deal for the price What you are not getting:  a leather shoe, much less a kids shoe that really tries to look like real leather.What you are getting:  a well-made plastic/synthetic shoe (seems like), that fits girls feet (at least mine) reasonably well, and a design that they really thought was cool.
B006OEY2NC Puma Golf Shoe I normally wear a size 10 but the shoe I initially received was snug.  My toes reached to the tip of the shoes and I knew that wearing them at a round of golf would be punishing.  I returned the shoe and got an 10-1/2 size.  The new shoe is still a bit snug but perhaps I could wear less thicker athletic socks.  Maybe this line of shoes were made naturally smaller.I was disappointed to learn that the upper part was made of synthetic leather.  Perhaps this is better in wet conditions but I really expected genuine leather.  I've never had synthetic leather before so I will withhold judgement on it until I've worn it a few times.  I suspect the shoe could be hotter as synthetic would not breath as well as leather.
B006QOJ8PM Not leather The shoes we received said they were made of synthetic materials, while the product description said they were leather.  Still a good looking shoe and nice fit.
B006QOJ8PM not leather They are not leather. Very beautiful, comfortable and the size is adequate. Look better than the picture. I am satisfied.
B006QPLSZ4 Real Leather I purchased a number of Puma's on the internet, some of them I have, couple I've returned, because of the quality!All Puma's run small (buy one size bigger), but this is the first pair made of real leather! Thank you, seller!
B006QQ0WYG Good leather shoe for Ferrari fans This shoe seems of good quality. All leather upper and good rubber sole. Got this at a very good deal less than 50 dollars and then this is the perfect gift for the Ferrari minded man. Not sure if I would want to pay full price for this product, but I guess you don't - just await your chance and get your pair!
B006QQ0WYG love them really great shoes , wont regret.  Comfortable and very nice leather. good good asdf asdf asd fd asd ff d s a f
B0071EBTCG Beware of Shoebacca Soccer boots were listed as Authentic Kangaroo leather, they are fully synthetic.  Due to a time commitment, I had to wear them immediately.  Shoebacca was not willing to replace them with the boots they advertised.  Not good business.
B0073IUO62 Tight and uneven Tight in every direction--probably by a half size.  Cushioning seems to be pretty good, though.  Forgot that I needed less leather in the upper for breathability.  This shoe is pretty much an ALL leather upper so I cannot see it having any breathability whatsoever.  There was also an issue of quality regarding them being uneven.  The left one was significantly thicker/higher than the right one.
B0073XIITC favorite shoes finally a leather/plastic leather? shoe over the toes that doesn't look like a nurse shoe ...versus the mesh material that are so popularno my feet do not overheat in these........wipes clean after the dogs step in mud (and god knows what) and step on my feet...repels water in the rain bettercomfortable to run or walk in
B0073XIITC Wrong material Fits good, but the problem is that the material at the site is leather and synthetic. But it is made of synthetic, rubber and other materials (I can see it on the shoes). I am very disappointed with this fact, it was very important for me to get leather shoes((((
B0073XIITC not sure how to review these shoes They fit.. .. .I wish they had more support because I can't walk all day in them without my feet hurting. .....but I can't get over the description of leather and synthetic.  Then having the description change to synthetic leather?  really?!!!!  I think that's a bit odd, but maybe it's just me.
B0077CLH3I not real nice leather The leather upper is kind of disappointing but overall it is a good deal with the price I paid. shipment is good.
B007IXCZZU Not leather!!!! I returned these shoes immediately!  They are NOT leather, as advertised.  The entire shoe is man-made materials.  Very stuff, almost no padding on the soles.  Definitely not as advertised!
B007J4AP0A Nice shoes They fit just as I expected them to.  They look very nice and I think they will hold up well since they are real leather.  I dig the contrast of the cream colored soles with the black leather.
B007M6AH2Q smaller than evo speed 3 but the k leather is great It is a little bit smaller than my previous evo speed 3, but it fits my feet when I wear thin socks. The k leather is great
B007M6AH2Q Top-class These boots are top class. Great, soft K leather (which covers all of the boot area above and in front of the Puma logo; the rest of the boot is a synthetic leather that matches the feel of the K leather remarkably well). The leather is just a slight bit thinner than true heritage boots (think the King Finale), but the quality, touch, and lightweight feel are first-class.The boots fit extremely well from the start. They should fit a bit snugly at first but quickly stretch nicely to a perfect fit. The boots have an anatomical toe shape that really hugs the small toes and fits my slightly wide foot perfectly.Soleplate and mixed conical and bladed studs are brilliant. The Sole flexes just slightly at the forefoot but is nice and stable, while the studs provide perfect traction on the relatively firm fields I play on in Central Texas.The padded insole and synthetic suede heel make the boot really comfortable, as well. No stud pressure, even on the aforementioned firm Texas pitches.If there is one downside to these boots, I'd say the thin K leather may wear out a bit faster than a true heritage K leather or a calfskin, but I think if they're taken care of they will wear just fine. I've worn mine biweekly for a couple of months and they still look pretty good.
B007MAYD2C 5 weeks and done These shoes wore out very quickly.  Holes on the tops of both shoes after average wear.  No hiking/soccer/football/rugby etc....just normal wear and tear and they tore.  Last pair of non leather pumas we will buy.  The leather ones lasted forever or at least until her feet got too big
B007SLGLX4 Puma Not as described they are not leather and not the best quality por the price, but they look ok and easy to put on and off.
B007WQH1SY Good leather cleats for the price I own this soccer cleats for several weeks and so far I'm satisfied. As all new shoes they fit very tightly and it will take 2-3 games to adjust to your foot (as they partially made from leather). If you have too wide foot, it may take longer or they do not fit you at all. In general I like them and consider as a good purchase for the money I spent.
B008A6YFQQ They're nice cleats, but not great if your feet are ... They're nice cleats, but not great if your feet are a little wider, as mine are. You'd think they would be, as they're calf-skin leather, but really only the white part is leather. Those great swathes of blue are some tough synthetic that doesn't give AT ALL. It's really too bad Puma doesn't make the Kings for women anymore.
B008AL36G6 UPPER IS NOT LEATHER Price was okey, but uppers is posted as leather, and is not, is a sort of PU and looks very cheap, have used them only a couple times and looks like the material is going to crack.
B008ALI936 It fit as I expected!!! The size fits perfectly, Color its cool. I do not like much that is synthetic leather and lightweight, but it's okay.
B008ALWBFS Puma shoe great for indoor, i recommend if you do buy this, to buy a leather cleaner with it so it REMAINS clean!
B008ALWEDW preliminary review The material is good, a little softer and tackier than your average cheapo synthetic leather. The fit is great for an average foot, not as wide as mine, but it can stretch. The sole seems grippy, I haven't played with it yet, so I will update accordingly, but it has the right amount of flex for indoor soccer. There is a Momentta that looks the same but is real leather for $65, so you can check that out as well. I didn't mind the synthetic because it's half the weight, and half the price as well...
B008ALXVMK Great boots. Great boots. Great price.  They fit well, true to size, and although the leather is obviously not k-leather, it's pretty nice.
B008ALXVMK Nice shoes, Very happy I bought these for my son. He's very happy with them. He had been wearing synthetic the past few years, and likes the feel of the real leather.
B008F06KB0 disapointed First of all why do they say Leather sneaker? they are not leather, they are vinyl, and size 9 was to big so I return it and got size 8.5, they fit better, but they are very uncomfortable, the way the outsole is, it hurts the feet, I'm really disapointed with these shoes, Im going to return them
B008QY1X0S Shoe uppers not as advertised When I ordered the PUMA AMP golf shoes I understood they had leather uppers as promoted on the website. However, when they arrived a sticker on the insole indicated they were instead manufactured of a synthetic material. Amazon immediately replaced them but, with the same shoe.On receipt of the second pair of the same shoes I called a customer service representative for Amazon who immediately contacted a customer service representative for PUMA. As I submit this review I'm still waiting to hear back from PUMA. However, that representative did state that the material may be a &#34;synthetic leather&#34;, rather than the traditional animal skin leather, but they(the representative) would advise me further once they had some feedback.It just seemed a little odd that if the shoes were manufactured with a &#34;synthetic leather&#34; material rather than real leather that PUMA didn't promote them as such. Appears that PUMA may not have provided all the appropriate informatiion about these golf shoes when they made them available for sale with Amazon.
B008R07Z44 Totally wrong description - ripped off!!!! Terrible!!! These shoes are not leather as described in the listing, they are made of some synthetic material. In a few wears these shoes are going to stink to high heaven. Also, their detailing is SILVER, not WHITE as described.I have NEVER bought a pair of Pumas that are not made of leather before. They are probably fakes. I could return them but Amazon won't return to me the full postage costs, which from my location exceed their limit of $15. WILL NEVER BUY FROM AMAZON AGAIN!!!!
B009FD2LM8 Not like previous Voltaics I ended up returning this shoe because there is very little ventilation.  My Voltaic 3's are mesh on top and I love it.  This has some crappy fake leather on top with tiny holes and polka dots.  NO thanks.  I'm a man.  I need my man shoes.
B009FN614C Love these shoes! I really like these shoes but the quality of the leather is not up to my standards.  The shoes are cute, comfortable, and classy.  You can dress them up or dress them down.  There are great, I just couldn't give them 5 stars because of the leather, it looks cheap.
B009G1UD2E Ugh!  ) : So very disappointed in the construction. the shoe was listed as &#34;perforated leather&#34; the entire shoe was synthetic. Would've been great had it been constructed from leather!
B009MNYG1U Three Stars It's okay but the leather isn't of the best quality
B00AOCE7IA NOT LEATHER!! I like the shoe, but was VERY DISAPPOINTED when I received them and they were not leather as is listed!!I'm keeping them but not happy about false advertising.
B00AOCE7IA NOT Leather! These shoes fit me as expected with a sleek look, BUT they are NOT leather as described! The label inside the shoe says:Upper: Other Materials/SyntheticLining: TextileSole: RubberDisappointing, but I already wore them and like the look enough to keep them. Just be forewarned!
B00AONVA52 I have never received so many compliments about my shoes before! They tend to get dirty easily but are easy to wash. The sole is more comfortable than I expected, and the leather creases heavily as expected in most leather products. I was very pleased that the bottom of the shoe does not squeak on linoleum surfaces at work. Very stylish and comfortable!
B00AOOH730 Not leather This is listed as a leather shoe. I bought them - they are not leather - they are suede yes, but that doesn't mean leather. That means the listing is false.  You can't get leather at this price - or apparently honesty either.
B00AOOK2OG Great once you get the size These sneakers are Extremely comfortable.  I love them and have been wearing them since I got them.  Having said that BEWARE of the size issue.  As others have said in their comments you need to go 1 size up.  I wear size 11 and got them and were too small.  Amazon is great and I was able to exchange them with no hassle to size 12.  Do yourself a favor and don't make my mistake just go one size up and you can't go wrong with these.  Others have said that they are narrow.  I have fat feet and after wearing them for 2 or 3 days they conformed to my feet and stretched to cradle my foot.  This is because the leather is very soft.  And yes these are leather uppers not like what is in the description.  If you go to the Puma site they state that they are leather.  Only the tongue of the shoe is vinyl. The stitching on the top makes the leather conform to your every move.
B00B4S2QUE Stylish and great value For me, these fit perfectly true to size. It's not quite clear from the picture, but the upper (except for the puma detail) is not leather... it is some synthetic woven fabric. Puma always holds up well for me, and these look fantastic.
B00B5W0FHK Five Stars Nice leather shoes for girls.
B00C6BOILS leather or  not I do not know what type of material  is &#34;other material&#34; but I do know that it is not leather .  I thought I would be getting leather but received a synthetic substance.  Maybe its my fault for not checking  the fine print.  Shoes of lesser value were made from the real stuff.
B00CIZ6NH4 Item not as shown Item shows as blue with white leather. Arrives as purple with grey leather. Not as expected and return would be at my expense. Disappointed.
B00DOE8S9O suck I just got this shoes they look cool and all but the front tip of the shoe leather bands so easy not cool I can just cut that part with a knife I was thinking the top tip leather was going to be hard just like any other shoe smh I will never buy this type of shoes ever I will throw them away what a waste of money :/
B00DOEHZXE Package was poor This is an excellent shoe. I love it. PUMA Leather Disc Cage Lux is a outstanding products, 3 colors are all good.
B00DUL6J7Y Good sneakers for the good price My daughter is very happy with those sneakers. She wants to wear them everywhere.I like leather upper. I prefer leather inside too, but PUMA uses synthetic. Anyway I like Drift Cat from PUMA. Last year I bought the similar model. I like the fashion look and the BMW logo :)
B00DUL8BQQ Puma Sneaker These shoes are not leather which is stated on the product description. However, they are fashionable and comfortable to run around in and also are easy to clean.
