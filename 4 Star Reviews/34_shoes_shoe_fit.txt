B000C4XHJA Puma socks rock! I love these socks.  My style is a bit understated, so I would have preferred less &#34;loud&#34; color accents, but I realize these colors are popular right now.  I got past the color because I love how comfortable they are!
B000FVZ1YE Feel & look nice, but **way** too large I'm 5'10&#34; 160lbs, with a 30&#34; waist & relatively large thighs.Usually, if shorts/pants don't fit, it's because they were either too big in the waist or too small in the thighs. These must be made for rugby and football players, though, because they're the first item I've encountered that fit well in the waist but are **massively** too large through everywhere else, fitting exactly like some of the boxers I own... Too bad I bought these elsewhere, where they do not accept undergarment returns...
B000K7EIME Like wearing slippers Love this shoe.  I am a nurse and am on my feet most of the day.  These shoes are comparable to wearing slippers.  I usually wear a 7.5 shoe - based on other reviews I read I ordered an 8 and it was a wise choice.  Only downside - I wish there were a little more &#34;padding&#34; on the sole - but I just supplemented with an OTC product.  Will definitely buy again!!!
B000R4XHRC Worst GV I Ever Own I had various Puma's start from 80's, including GV's. This is the worst knocked down version, Made in China of course. No grain leather, stiff non-&#34;rubber&#34; sole, somewhat small (order 0.5 size extra to be ok). I know how good this model used to be. Puma let us down big time.
B000R4XHRC A bit to narrow. To narrow for &#34;D&#34; width.  .  Foreign made brand shoes should conform to accepted American  average measurements.  No more business to you from me.
B001B8C7PQ Lasted 5 years! Purchased this about 5 years ago in and this last THAT long. I'm very rough on my accessories so that's a BIG credit to this brand. It's a perfect weekend bag. Overtime, like with most bags, the handle began to &#34;chip&#34; and the vinyl began to flake off.
B001CHG1YY A Pleasant surprise I read other reviews before ordering and ordered a half size larger. I'm barely a 10.5, ordered an 11 and they fit well. Probably could wear a 10.5 but these are fine. They're well made and comfortable right out of the box. I suspect I'll order another pair because they seem to have become my &#34;go to&#34; shoe for daily wear. Recommended.
B001CHG1YY Perfect color These are a really great shade of blue and are really close to the color shown on the product page.I have a couple of these in different colors and I love the retro look just like back in high school(back in the day)when my parents couldn't afford to buy this style shoe for any of their children but we had shoes,and food in our bellies.Once I stumbled on the first pair of these I knew I had to have them just because I always loved this style with the suede and the colors.They fit well with the thinner sport socks and snug with thicker cotton/blend socks.And I don't recommend wearing these everyday as I've always heard if you can afford it buy&#34; really well made shoes&#34;if you want to wear them  as an everyday shoe or have a few to several pairs of shoes to switch with that are of course comfortable and these are comfortable.I highly recommend this shoe!
B001CHG1YY Knock offs??? My son was VERY unhappy with these shoes.....he already owns a pair of Puma's similar to these and he has loved them.  But, these are a different story.  One shoe fits the other one is too big, WAY too big.  I think these must be &#34;knock offs&#34;.  They certainly aren't  like the other ones he has.  I am returning them.
B001CHG1YY Great shoe I love the shoes looks great feels great . Lots of compliments on &#34; the old school look&#34; arch in right shoe a little high but I expect them to break in
B001CHG1YY Cool sneaker. I never carried footwear of this brand. I always carried Adidas Superstar 2,Campus,Stan Smith. I bought these sneakers &#34;to get acquainted&#34; with them. I liked design and a coloring. I remained is happy. They well look and are convenient.
B001CHG1YY RED ORDERED, PINKISH RECEIVED FIT AS EXPECTED, BUT COLORATION WAS SOMEWHAT PINKISH AS OPPOSE TO &#34;RED&#34;.KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK AS YOU HAVE DONE
B001CHG1YY Sweet Shoe - Just a little small. I really like these shoes and bought them for a few outfits that the look great with.  I wish however that I would have bought a half size larger as I don't wear them enough to properly &#34;break them in&#34;.  Otherwise good looking shoes.  Look just like the picture.
B001CHG1YY Bad fit, color description not accurate After trying on these shoes, I don't understand how there are so many good reviews. There is a seam that runs down the inside of the shoe that feels unnatural and is very uncomfortable. I have a few other pairs of Puma and they do not have this seam. The second issue is that the color description says &#34;Black/white&#34; yet the stripe on the side is actually a tan/off-white color. The sole is white but the stripe is off-white causing the stripe to look dirty right out of the box. It looks like someone splashed dirty pond water on the side of a new shoe. I'm returning these shoes.
B001J2POA4 Somewhat difficult to use. Setting the watch, was a 2 day task. And my husband says every time he looks down at it he can never tell the time because it's always saying &#34;its puma time&#34;. I know its just a coincidence, but it its kind of annoying. He does get many compliments on the style and how unique it is, but he would rather have functionality.
B001QDEV1E Large is too big I'm a 36 waist and about 34 long and the large feels too big(long and wide) for me. I'm returning, otherwise great materials.
B002CVU5IW Irregular Product was irregular, &#34;out-let&#34; item. Do no buy. Package I got was ripped open in top corner and taped shut. Item inside had black markings and both shirts were irregular-sides did not match. SOOOO upset with AMAZON.
B002EENI40 Awesome These things are awesome! They even coaxed a &#34;cool!&#34; out of my normally pretty apathetic daughter--what more evidence do we need?
B002EENI40 Love I have now owned 5 pairs of these shoes, and wear them as my &#34;go-to&#34; casual shoe. Puma El Rey's are in my opinion the best shoes ever made! Please keep making them Puma!!!
B002EL3KQE OMG My three year old daughter LOVES these shoes.  They are a &#34;slim&#34; fit.  I ordered a 9, when she wears an 8 in most shoes (8 1/2 in some sandals).  I was thinking they would make a good Christmas gift.  Decided to let her wear them now because I was afraid she would outgrow them.  Besides that, they are well made (sturdy) and, most importantly to a three-year old) super cool.
B002EL3KQE SEAHAWKS My son loves these shoes he had them in black before but they didn't have black in his size this time. They just happen to be Seahawk colors so that is great. Order one size up Puma runs a bit small. He runs around the house saying &#34;Go Seahawks&#34; The puma skeleton lights up as he walks and that's pretty rad too.
B002EL3KQE Awesome Light-ups Our son loves light up shoes, but we're not into hokey shoes with all sorts of characters on them - these meet both our standards. Interestingly, the cat on the side lights up, but it's the puma's skeleton that lights up and flashes a few time - kinda cool.They look great as athletic shoes or as a more casual shoe with khakis and a button up. Our son is 3, so we appreciate not having to help lace up his sneakers every time - he can put them on by himself.And he literally seems to run faster. Maybe he just feels faster, but I'm buying the &#34;these shoes will make you run faster hype,&#34; because he takes off like a rocket every time we go outside with them on and says, &#34;look how fast I am now!&#34;
B002EL3KQE Love it! It is a sport shoe and a beautifull sneaker too. I buyed it for my 2-years son. He loved the lights from the &#34;Puma&#34;. Its a great shoe and great quality. The colors are as shown. It is easy to put in and lightweight. I think its a perfect sneaker for the age. The sole is good for a sport shoe.
B002EL3KQE My daughter loves them This was the first &#34;real&#34; sneaker we purchased for my daughter. She used to wear sandals and it appeared her feet had an inward pronation (I think I am saying that right). After wearing these for a few weeks her ankles look much better and she loves the shoes. We didn't even realize they light up until we purchased them.
B002EL3KQE Son loves them! My son is about to turn two and HE RUNS.  When I say he runs, I mean all out sprints for 10 minutes straight.  Most shoes at the store are cute and all, but they are bulky and flat on the bottom with very little, if any, flex to them  After reading the other reviews, and being a puma wearer myself, we chose these for their feather-weight, flexibility, and the light up puma skeleton is a cool effect.  We would have never put some cutsie light up shoes on our son, but these aren't cutsie.  They are actually kind of bad a$$!  He just outgrew these, so we got the exact same, just a different color scheme for him.  &#34;Daniel, come put on your boots please.&#34;  &#34;No thank you, I want my puma shoes daddy!&#34;
B002EL3KQE Size problems, but she loves them. We ordered our first pair in the size our granddaughter wears, but they turned out to be too small. After returning them and getting one size larger we gave them to our granddaughter. Her school is, &#34;The Parker Pumas,&#34; so they were perfect to begin her second grade year.
B002EL3KQE Fits smaller than normal My 4-year old loves light up shoes, but the majority of the shoes that light up are garish and simply look ridiculous.  At least with these Pumas my kid can have his light up shoes while looking stylish!  The shoe is well constructed , velcro straps work as expected, and the shoe flexes very well.  The light up pattern on the Puma is the skeleton, which my kid thought was &#34;awesome!!&#34;Fit is a bit smaller than other shoes, so buy a size larger than usual and you'll be fine.  We were sad when my son outgrew these shoes.
B002EL3KQE My 4 year old son loves these!!! Fanastic!!  These are comfortable, fashionable a great brand, good price, durable and they light up.  He loves these!!  He calls them his &#34;new pumped up kicks&#34;
B002EL3KQE SAVE YOUR MONEY The shoe is nice but size does run small.  I would ahve been satisfied if I hadn't seen a much more sturdier &#34;Spiderman&#34; shoe at Walmart for 1/2 the price.
B002EL3KQE Great fit and quality Easy for a 4 year old to get off/on herself. My daughter, who loves jaguars (she thinks the puma is a jaguar), loves how the shoes light up and &#34;make me run fast!&#34; The light is nice and bright too.
B002EL3KQE My son loves them These were the only &#34;light up&#34; shoes I would purchase for my son. I am totally against character light up shoes because they just look cheap. Unfortunately, after about 3 months one of the shoes just stopped lighting up. Luckily, my son isn't really bothered by this.
B002EL3KQE perfect The puma on the side lights up as you step, but shows a rather detailed skeleton!  My 4.5 year old is really impressed and so am I!  They fit very well, the velcro fits firmly with no overhangs like converse.  They match everything.  Well made, couldn't ask for more.  My son says that they make him go &#34;really fast, and faster, and even more fast.&#34;
B002EL3KQE Fine for the cost I didn't rank these higher because they are very &#34;stiff&#34; and I have had trouble getting them on my little one.  Also, note that I failed to read the product details...these light up!  I know some people would like this, but for me it was a surprise and had I known, I would have chosen a different pair of shoes.  The last pair I purchased were saucony and, in retrospect, I would have purchased those again in a larger size.
B002EL3KQE Too small, too narrow, too uncomfortable. Too small, too narrow, and the ankle is so high in the back of the shoe that my 4 year old said a &#34;no thank you&#34; to these shoes. So disappointed because they are super cute. But what's the point of making awesome shoes if they don't fit?
B002EL3KQE Wore out a little too quick One of the velcro strips ripped last week.  The shoe still looks basically brand new after 4 months of use.  Don't think that should happen but gave 3 stars because my 6 year old absolutely &#34;loved&#34; these shoes and cried when they broke.  I got a pretty good deal on them but wouldn't pay more than $20 for them because my kid didn't even have a chance to outgrow them.  We typically buy See Kai Run and never had a problem with quality like these shoes.
B002EL3KQE Small but nice looking The shoe fit nice in length but was too small in the straps.  My son has a very normal foot, its not like a fat club foot or anything and I found the straps didn't fit as pictured and the tongue of the shoe was too short sliding under the top strap.  I ended up keeping the shoe thinking he would &#34;wear them in&#34; but it was a problem the whole life of the shoe.  The lights worked right and my son loved them.
B002EL3KQE My twins love these! This is the first pair of &#34;big boy&#34; shoes that boys have had and we bought them as a birthday present for them. They love them!
B002EL3KQE Light up Puma These Puma's are great shoes. My daughter loves how the &#34;kitty&#34; lights up when she steps down. The shoes look great, and fit her well. True to size. Great quality that she'll outgrow before she wears them out. Definitely recommend.
B002EL3MCQ LOVE LOVE LOVE I just got these in the mail today for my 6 year old son and he was ecstatic. He hates shoe laces but doesn't like the &#34;baby look&#34; of so many of the velcro sneakers on the market.  I do think these run a little small, but I planned for that based on other comments that were made.
B002EL3MCQ Loving it! I have been a traditional fan of Converse sneakers, and that's mostly what my daughter has worn (she's 21 months). I bought these for the price and &#34;reverse velcro&#34; style.  My daughter instantly fell in love and can easily run in these sneakers.  I think they hold her feet better than the Converse...I plan to purchase again.
B002EL3MCQ Excellent shoe for toddlers My daughter is 3yrs old and we purchased two pairs of these shoes as we were unsure about sizing.  Turns out sizing is exact - not too sure about the other reviews about it being a little on the small size?  The shoe is lightweight so it's easy for her to run around without &#34;tripping&#34; over herself.  The colour is very cute and the straps are easy for her to put her shoes on and take them off herself.  I'm glad I have two pairs as now she'll have the next size up when she outgrows the current pair.
B002EL3MCQ Note to self... Oops! I forgot that a two year old probably should not wear white shoes to school...Nonetheless, I love how they fit her. I especially love that they are Velcro. I am a steadfast believer that young kids who do not know how to tie their shoes should only wear Velcro or some type of shoe that they can slip on and off. I also like how there are two sections of Velcro to close. They are in opposite directions; a perfect learning opportunity for kids to understand &#34;opposites&#34;.
B002EL3MCQ Okay We're a huge fan of PUMAs for our kid's shoes.. durability, ease for them to put on themselves and (again) durability!  Those these PUMA shoes are fitting the durability and ease of use, I have to agree with other reviewers that they &#34;look&#34; cheap.  They're a shiny leather and remind me of referee shoes - lol, which is fine, if you like those kind of shoes :-)Bottom line, these shoes definitely do the job we're asking them to do!
B002ODEYE4 Happy Eight Year Old My grandson has slowly become &#34;aware&#34; of fashion and what is cool and what isn't.  I ordered this based on the reviews and he thinks his new jacket is pretty &#34;cool&#34;!  Yeah Grandma!!!  jmg
B002Q9XHCQ I like it. I was expecting a slightly tighter fit.  I did not notice the &#34;loose fit&#34; information until I received the jacket.
B002RLBC8E There is "puma" written behind ankle The advertisement makes it look like there isn't any writing on the socks, but the word &#34;puma&#34; is written on the ankle of the sock.  Nothing special about these socks overall.  They are just average.
B003BNY8QK what new but, broken I ordered this since im younger and had Christmas money right of the back. Yet when receiving this I clicked the light and their is a red smurg in the back of the back light. not to big a deal but disappointing very disappointing. I ignored it yet when I kept looking I couldn't take it. again I'm young so I don't know how to get a &#34;new&#34; one or replace or whatever... I need help
B003BNY8ZQ Sporty but nice I was looking for a nice/sporty watch to wear at work, and this was definitely it!  Great size if you're looking for a bit of a &#34;bigger&#34; watch too.
B003BNY95U ok Is not a &#34;wow&#34; watch. It looks better in the pic's. But for the paid price is a good deal
B003BNY96E Beautiful! Better than i expected Bought this for a friend but once it arrived and i saw it in person, i LOVED it.  Might need to buy this for myself! Very stylish. The &#34;gold&#34; trim looks more bronze than it does gold.
B003DTSPHA Puma  Wrist watch Puma SchmumaPoor to Mediocre. Not water resistant.Seems slick, but not worth a &#34;tick.&#34;Not worth the buy with shipping & handling, etc.
B003EE49MY knockaround Bought these  &#34;old school&#34; shoes to wear,just for running errands. Would not recomend for extended wear or for playing a sport. I had to replace the insole for better cushioning. I should say that I am not a light weight (215lbs.).Perhaps that would account for the need for a better insole.
B003EE7XGS Cute shoes My daughter has a narrow foot so I knew she would have some room in them. I had to get over the shoes looking a bit &#34;big&#34; on her feet. She likes them and so do I! Hopefully. They will last throughout the summer.
B003EE9O4W Runs small & falling apart... My 4 and 1/2 year old son has been wearing these shoes, maybe every other day, for the past 4 weeks and they are already falling apart! He uses them to play on the play yard at school and normal day to day activities. I can't believe we spent the money on &#34;nice&#34; shoes for them to last a month. Unimpressed. Also, the shoes are very narrow, definitely run small.
B003EE9O4W Love these shoes These are my 2 year old son's favorite &#34;fast shoes.&#34; This is his second pair. The first pair he wore everyday and they still looked great - he simply grew out of them. He was so excited I was able to find him the same shoes in a bigger size
B003EEH7NM Great Value! My 3-year old Grandson is between sizes, so I wanted to get him a pair of &#34;now&#34; shoes.  He is very active, and growing fast and these shoes are perfect!  They are well-made and I am very happy with this choice.
B003EEH7NM skater shoes These shoes are very cute but too wide; classic &#34;skater&#34; shoes and we had to send them back. Nice colors.
B003EEH7NM Bought two pairs for an outdoor kid... We bought two pairs for outdoor playing and they lasted a long time.  Endures lots of wear and tear.  Eventually the sides start peeling off - but very late in the shoe's &#34;life-cycle.&#34;
B003FZL4YS Look nice but hurt Inside of shoe rubbed against toes causing blistering and discomfort (w/ and w/o sock). Shoe does not stretch.Felt like my feet were &#34;tired&#34; in these shoes.
B003MAJWCW Nice shoe It's pretty thin so doesn't support much, but I prefer that. Nice quality and even though white, is easy to keep clean. I also loved the packaging the shoe came in. Puma is trying to be more &#34;green&#34; and I'm always looking for that in a company.
B003MAJWCW Wish Puma would expand this line of shoes My GF loves her new Pumas. She reports they fit well, are comfy as a running shoe, and stylish with many looks. She gets complements around the office all the time. They look good with more formal slacks (she does a lot of running around) as well as more casual jeans (for Fridays.) In place of &#34;Clarks&#34; (think nursing industry), these are by far, superior and more youthful.
B003MAJWCW Horrible Condition Ordered these shoes for my wife. Received them in &#34;new&#34; condition, but they were returned back due to yellowing on many places of shoe and stitching seemed to be coming apart. Wont ever order from this company again. Only gave a star cuz i couldnt post this without providing one.
B003MAJWCW Five Stars Actually they fit better than expected.  Very comfortable sneakers that but a bounce in my step.  Also, they have the smoother sole that I wanted when doing yard work.  Last &#34;tennis&#34; shoes I had collected mud that had to be dug out of the grooves.
B003MAJWCW I am an RN I am on my feet all day, and NEVER thought these shoes would be comfortable. I was so wrong.  Thinking you needed a &#34;cushy&#34; sole to stand on all day, I have always worn Asics and Dansko's.  I find that these shoes give me the proper amount of comfort in the heel and the ball of my foot.  May have something to do with the support piece they use (that you can see in the shot of the bottoms).  In fact, when I come home, I used to kick my shoes off first thing. I can continue to wear these for several hours after I get off shift. My foot tends to run a little wide across the bridge, and I take a solid 10 1/2.  The 11's fit perfectly.  So that being said, you may consider ordering a 1/2 size larger if you have a little wider foot.  I also discovered the letter &#34;P&#34; in the description indicates &#34;patent&#34; leather, and I now own a pair of comfortable, if not shiny, pair that are great in the rain.  In fact, I have 3 pair of the Soleil style, and am always searching for a great deal on another pair.  I think you could consider these feel like being barefoot, but with support.
B003ZJCEXO Somewhat small The jacket fits and feels ok but I wish the arms were a tad longer. I am 5'11&#34; and the chest and waist fit fine.
B003ZJCEXO Perfect fit My husband is 6'3&#34;. I bought him the size large because that is what he normally wears in shirts. This jacket fit him perfectly and he really loves it.
B003ZJCEXO Style and Sport I have now owned this track jacket for over a year and I can say it looks as good as new.  I run a &#34;L&#34; in the Puma world and ordered accordingly, the fit is perfect, just enough room, yet still has a slimming and sporty effect.  The logo and cat are velour and ironed on, so I try not to wash too regularly.  I love this thing, from the gym to running around town it's great.  If you are craving a sporty and fresh ensemble, pair it with the T7 track pants in Ribbon Red.
B003ZW2FJO great pants but why so long? Smart and slim looking pants. I got the blue with red and the matching jacket for my husband...makes a good looking outfit.  He wears a 34 waist and the medium pants fit snug in the waist without a lot of loose fabric in the rear end.Nice and soft on the inside with the tricot fabric backing.Like other reviewers mentioned these are way long...probably at least a 34&#34; length.  That's a Problem!
B003ZW2FJO I like 'em! Received these as a Christmas gift, and they are a keeper!  I'm 6'3&#34; and they are a tiny bit short, but not so much that it is a problem.  Very comfortable and well made.
B003ZW2FJO better be tall i am 5' 8&#34; and i ordered size medium. when i wear track pants i wear them just under my bellybutton. these are almost 3 inches too long.
B003ZW2FJO Puma is the Best The pants run a bit long. My husband is 6'1&#34;, I had to hem them approx 1&#34; to prevent from dragging on ground. Puma quality is super nice, my husband wears mostly Puma & Nike, loves the quality!
B003ZW2FJO Comfy & Stylish I was in the market for a new pair of track pants and these fit the bill.  I run a &#34;L&#34; in the Puma world and these pants were great.  Inseam and waist were spot on.  Great for a lazy day at home or a trip to the gym.  These go perfectly with the Heroes T7 track jacket also in Ribbon Red.
B003ZW2FJO If you're a "Medium", order "Small". I'm a 34&#34;W 32&#34; Inseam and based on a previous purchase of medium, I felt like I was wearing a &#34;large&#34;.  Since I bought the jacket and pants as a set on clearance at a local outlet store, I sold the pants on eBay and purchased a small here.  The small fits perfectly.
B003ZZ1CY0 Hard to see I had to return this item because it was defected (I could not set the time or use any of the functions). The looks were very casual and would have been suitable for a young girl or as a workout watch. The main issue I had was that the time was difficult to see especially in bright light and in very dim light.  Keep in mind that none of the features worked so I could not see if the &#34;light&#34; feature was helpful. I would not recommend this for &#34;old&#34; eyes.
B003ZZ1CY0 Well made and stylish This variant is perfect for a woman's wrist.  I liked the sleek &#34;one piece&#34; construction of this watch.  The numerals also show well.
B0041SM87K Bummer If I could give this no stars I would. The watch arrived in a beat up box and did not work. I kept it for a couple days hoping it would &#34;wake up&#34; but did not. It was a little bulkier than I had expected too. Returning it was so easy though. I taped up the box put it outside and ups picked it up. The amazon return team was so helpful and nice they made it fool proof
B0042AN2K4 AWESOME! This shoe has been the best shoe I have ever purchased. I watched a lot of &#34;youtube&#34; reviews to get an idea on how this product would fit. It is a little sleek and slender so if you have wide feet I would recommend buying a size bigger. The pictures here do not even justify how great this shoe really is. I have had mine for quite a while now and they aren't even worn out. This shoe is so comfortable you could sleep in them! All in all this is a great buy! Money well spent! I will be getting another pair soon.
B00439GBOS Excellent arch support the following was stated by my dad whom i bought this for.......&#34;If you do lots of walking this is the shoe for you. They are very comfortable and keep your foot cool&#34;
B00439GCEM I expected more for the price I usually get cheapie sneakers, but I decided to treat myself with these. I was disappointed. Their redeeming quality is that they are comfortable even for my weird feet. I was really disappointed that after a very short time the color faded, and the piping frayed. The shoelaces kill me! They are a ribbon like material with metal end caps. Sure the ends never fray, which is great however the material makes it so they never stay tied, and you can't even be all nonchalant about them being untied because of the metal caps. &#34;i'll just tie my shoe when I get through the door/end of the hall, after I put down random object, ect....&#34; Nope! it's all clink, clink , clink. Stranger coming up to you, &#34;hey did you know your shoe is untied?&#34; Gee no I thought my feet were performing a drum solo to compliment my awesomeness! I don't totally regret buying them, but I won't buy them again.
B00439GCEM PUMA WOMEN'S SOLEIL FASHION SNEAKER Very comfortable and &#34;cool&#34;.  Good fit.  I have received compliments on the appearance of this sneaker.  I would purchase again.
B00439GCEM Comfortable from the first step I bought these sneakers for vacation and starting wearing them to &#34;break&#34; them in.  They were comfortable from the onset.  They are great for walking and provide good arch support.
B00439GCEM Cute- but not super comfy They're adorable. But I work in retail, and stand on my feet for hours at a time, and they clearly say &#34;fashion&#34; shoes, so I guess I wasn't suprised when my feet were aching after just a few hours at work, because of the lack of support. But I love them and wear them often, to school or just out shopping. And for the price, your really can't complain. :)
B00439GCEM Not Comfortable! These shoes do not meet up to Pumas quality or comfort. The shoe does say it is a &#34;Fashion Sneaker&#34; but they are very flimsy and rub the tops of your toes if you do not wear some sort of socks with them which makes your foot look wide.I did not send them back because I needed them to wear with everyday black pants however I would not purchase these again.
B00439GCEM Comfy and Stylish These shoes fit my foot like a glove.  They are extremely comfortable right out of the box.  Usually it takes me a few days to &#34;break in&#34; new shoes but not these.  They have great arch support.  I have a wider foot than most and that was no problem for these shoes.  They even make my foot look slimmer.  They have a lot of &#34;give&#34; which means they are easy to slip on.  I'm a fan of just slipping on shoes and even when tied I can slip them on, sometimes without even bending over and using my hand.  I would highly recommend these babies to anyone looking for comfort and style in an everyday tennis shoe.
B00439GCEM Pumas are now even better I've always appreciated the trim style of Puma shoes, and I needed a minimal kind of sole to combat plantar fasciitis.  This shoe really works well, and the &#34;new&#34; Pumas are distinctly longer and a bit wider than those I purchased several years ago.  My old size 7 was a little too short and narrow; the new size 7 is just right for one foot, and a little big on the other--but cushy socks solved that problem.  These are the best shoes for long, energetic walks that I've had for a long time!
B00439GCEM first pair of pumas these shoes are great for the most part, but I had to give it 4 out of 5 stars because when they arrived, the insole in one of the shoes somehow got &#34;crinkled&#34; at the toe part, like it didn't make it all the way to the toe part of the shoe.  I ended up trying to pull out the insole and straighten it out. Even now, it's still not completely smoothed out, which is a bit of of bummer, since the other shoe is quite comfortable. Maybe I'll just have to get used to wearing one &#34;lumpy&#34; shoe and one really comfy shoe.
B00439GCEM women's ;puma sneakers Sneakers arrived in a timely fashion and in good shape.  They feel awesome.  I purchased a pair over 6 years ago and should have purchased some before now but &#34;life got in the way&#34;.  I wore them for the first time today and did not want to take them off.
B004DSLVGC Room at the top. The size is a &#34;true fit.&#34;  Often, I need a size 10 for my normally wide foot.  However, one doesn't have to worry about it with this model of shoe.  While I like the style, I will buy a 9.5 next time.  Otherwise, it's excatly as I wanted.  Comfort is worth modifying my overall satisfaction.  My advice to you is &#34;just order the right size for you.&#34;  Satisfied AL.
B004GB0SNS SOME Pumas tend to run small I had a size 12 pair of Puma &#34;The Basket&#34; that might have been a quarter size too big.  I got a pair of size 12 Puma &#34;Elite:&#34; I couldn't even squeeze my foot into it; their size 13 is JUST big enough.  Pumas with a round toe, like &#34;The Basket,&#34; seem to be sized accurately, but the pointier-toed sneakers, like the &#34;Elite,&#34; and apparently these, run smaller, like they didn't take into account the fact that they taper at the toe.
B004GB11O8 Another Awesome warehouse deal Arrived quickly and looks brand new!  Love the warehouse deals section.  So many things to look at and super low prices compared to &#34;new&#34; prices.
B004GB11O8 Great sneakers for a great price Bought these as my everyday sneakers and have not been disappointed. I typically like a stylish shoe, but not overly so, and comfort of course is a big factor. I had been wearing Onitsuka Tigers before and I liked how they felt and looked, but I wanted something with a more solid sole. These are nice because they have a thick solid sole, I didn't want a &#34;skater&#34; shoe, and these aren't, they're a good medium between a tennis shoe and skater I think. They are comfy for my relatively wider foot and the insole is very plush. The white around the bottom wears off a little easy but it's no big deal. The color is excellent in general and for the price I paid (~$45) you can't beat it honestly.
B004GB1242 For my dad I got these sneakers for my dad and he loves them.  He says that they are very comfortable and he will stick to what he knows best &#34;PUMA&#34;.
B004GB1242 Buying several pairs Great shoe the fits my size &#34;D&#34; width. Very very  comfortable. I have received lots of complements on them. Shoe laces turning red now.
B004GB14HM Alright Decent shoe that wears out pretty quickly so don't expect them to stay &#34;fresh&#34;. They'll be looking pretty crumby following about 4 months of almost everyday wear. They also don't provide a lot of arch support, so this isn't the right shoe to wear if you're going to be walking long distances.
B004GB14HM Super comfy and lightweight I love how comfy these are, and they are super lightweight, which is also great. The style is nice and not over the top.My only concern is that they're exactly my size, with zero wiggle room in the toes. My toes are right up against the fronts. I ordered my normal size in &#34;M&#34; (didn't even realize that - just noticed, so I'm not sure I even had a choice). I ordered another paid of Pumas in a different model and just noticed the size was &#34;D&#34;. Not sure what the difference is, but those fit better - with more wiggle room.I'd say you'd want to either order these 1/2 size larger or research the &#34;D&#34; and &#34;M&#34; sizing and see where that takes you.
B004J4XMM6 2nd pair won't be the last !! I wore my first pair to death, washed a good few times in with the laundry.... just my all time fave sneaker.Perfect if you have a &#34;slim&#34; foot.And I will most deff. be getting a 3rd pair.
B004J4XNNO She loves these shoes My wife loves these shoes, no &#34;break-in&#34; required, comfortable from the 1st time she wore them. Do highly recommend these shoes.
B004K00GTG Cool looking...but My daughter really wanted a pair of cleats in a &#34;cooler&#34; color than the nice black kangaroo leather ones that I had been buying for her.  Well, these are a lovely bright blue, but after the first time she wore them the blue started to rub off.  Now after 4 games there is no blue left  in the toe area or the outside of the foot.  Basically any place that you would come into contact with the ball or the ground.  You also have to go up a whole size bigger than you would usually buy.  She wears a 7 1/2 shoe, but usually a 7 cleat.  In these I had to get an 8.
B004LC3UIW Puma shoes rock This is yet another pair of puma shoes in my sons &#34;I Like Ricky Fowler&#34; collection of puma products.  Everything Puma we have bought has been great quality and we get great wear out of it.
B004S08HE4 Looked ok but... I bought two pairs of these pants (size 14/16) for my 13 year old son. He is about 5' 4&#34;. Both were way too short. Bought the same size of Filas and they fit just fine.
B004SUANZU good deal, nice shoes i tried these on at a Puma store in Chicago while on vacation. the 10.5 were a perfect fit for me, and since i have historically been a 10.5, i would say that these are &#34;true to size.&#34; this is *very* important to check with puma, as it is *not* the case with all of their shoes. i had done some ordering online of puma for different models, and required 2 or 3 tries to &#34;get it right&#34; so i do recommend trying on puma in-store, in general. these seem like a safe bet for true to size though.they are comfortable, the price was very good, and i would recommend them as a cool-looking kind of retro-soled casual wear sneaker.
B004SUANZU Love them Love them, they're comfortable and they look awesome. Always go up a half size with Puma. I usually wear a size 7, but always get a &#34;W 7.5/M 6&#34; (US size) when I buy Pumas as they run a half size smaller. Perfect fit.
B004SUANZU My feet are apparently really strange. Tried my &#34;real size&#34;, too small by a lot.  Then I tried 1 size up, still no good.  Debating whether to try again or just go to the blasted shoe store.  :P
B004SUANZU They're green and comfortable If you don't want green suede shoes, or don't want people to notice your feet, don't buy these. If you like having noticeable shoes and green is a color you can enjoy, then these are for you.Fit is like most &#34;classic&#34; soccer shoes. I have two pairs of Pumas and 5 pairs of Sambas (2 Millenniums) and the fit is very similar.
B004SUANZU Super Comfortable I believe these are the most comfortable sneakers I've ever worn.  I have a flat foot so I decided to stop wearing the less supportive sneakers like &#34;Chucks&#34; because they left my feet and ankles a little sore by the end of the day. Unfortunately I read the reviews AFTER I ordered the first pair so I got my regular size and sure enough my toes were at the very top while sitting so I knew that if I were to walk in them all day they would hurt.  I sent them back and got a half size larger.  They fit wonderfully.
B004SUANZU FANTASTIC SHOE I will be ordering another pair of these shoes. They are better than Sketchers that &#34;used&#34; to be my preferred shoe.They are extremely comfortable and fit correctly according to the size chart. If you haven't yet tried these and are looking for new shoes...I highly recommend these. I'm now so sold on these shoes I am going to get my hubby a pair.An added bonus: You get a shoe box size litter bag that can be used for just about anything.
B004TLARJ0 Uncomfortable sole The sole on these shoes is extremely uncomfortable to stand or walk on due to the narrow strip of rubber on the bottom of the shoe.  If they are in fact &#34;driving shoes&#34; as the inside sole says, okay.  But if you need to walk or stand, OUCH.
B004WLEF6S What I know about "Clydes":  NICE SHOE Soooo comfortable and good looking.  I just bought them because of the color and they are attractive to me.  Men always comment on how good looking they are and ask me what do I know about &#34;Clydes&#34;?  I'm a Knicks fan and especially of Walt &#34;Clyde&#34; Frasier.  Fan or not they are a good looking shoe.  I'm thinking about getting another pair.
B004WLEF6S Great shoes I love these shoes. They are comfortable and stylish. They took virtually no time to break in, and they just look good.  My only complaint is that they look like they are gray and kind of a bright lilac color in the pictures, but when I received them, they were gray and very blue.  Makes sense since the color in the description is &#34;princess blue,&#34; but I went by the product picture and thought I was getting purple.  Oh well, they are still good looking, and I love 'em.
B004WLEF6S Pumas rock! Pt.3 Clyde Pumas are great whether you're playing ball or just hanging out casually.  They are very comfortable as are all the &#34;Classic&#34; and &#34;Clyde&#34; models.
B004WLEF6S Old School Pumas are the Bomb I had bought these shoes for a friend of mine for Christmas and when they arrived I loved the look and had to order me a pair of Clyde Script by Puma.i ordered mine in blue and just love the look and comfort of these shoes.designed in 1968 for the great Walt &#34;Clyde&#34; Frazier.they just don't make shoes like these anymore.i would order a pair of these in every color if I couldS.ParkPhx,Az.
B004WLEF6S A Very Cool Classic !! 5 Stars now and always for the Puma &#34;Clyde&#34; !! Top Quality Suede soft and easily flexible, awesome color, great fit, very comfortable right out of the box !! A Real Beauty !!
B004XD0PFA Puma Women's Slic &#34;big cat&#34; I bought it as a present for someone. When i saw it I liked so much than I decided to look after Puma's watches to buy one for myself.
B004ZIP5GW Had to return The shoes were not only *extremely* narrow but felt like I was running with &#34;planks&#34; attached to my feet. I would definitely not buy these and had to return them.
B004ZIP5GW I got a gold star :-) I got my husband a &#34;just because&#34; gift and he loved them. They are comfortable and very stylish. He is the envy of his Carolina Pather friends becuase they are the colors of the team. He loves them :-)
B004ZIP5GW Slick looking, comfortable shoes Was able to snag these on a gold box deal for roughly $40.Could not be more pleased. They seem very very durable and they look great.One thing to note that you may not notice in the pictures (I sure didn't) is that these shoes DO NOT have a &#34;tongue&#34;The part where a separate tongue would be is actually fully attached and the same material that wraps around the side of your feet and your heel.  It's hard to explain but it's not a problem, just a unique thing I didn't expect when I pulled them out of the box.I will say they do seem to run a hair small? Historically I would wear size 13 nike's but my last 2 pairs of shoes (sketchers go runs) and these, have both needed to be size 14.
B004ZIP5GW OK for walking around - NOT a running shoe These shoes look great but there's no way I would use these for any sort of running/training program.  I walk a lot for work and need something comfortable.  I don't know if it's the manufacturing of my right shoe but I have a bump on the inside where my right little toe rubs.  Hoping it will wear down (not my toe) but not the greatest shoe I've ever bought.  I still wear them every day and hope the &#34;break in&#34; right.
B004ZIP5GW Am I the new Spiderman in these shoes I like these shoes and they fit well. They were sent to me right on time. When I went to Costco, they called me Spiderman because of these bright red shoes. I have a great sense of humor so I do not care. These are well made shoes and they fit nice. I hate tightening my shoes because of foot issues, so these are better than I thought they would be. Thank You, Patrick, aka &#34;Spiderman&#34;
B004ZIP5GW Excellent shoe I was a little tight, but it needed to be &#34;worn out&#34; a bit to stretch the leather. This is an excellent shoe from a great brand.
B004ZIP5GW Colorful and comfortable! I bought these shoes mainly as something to wear with blue jeans and a t-shirt which is something that they excel at.  They are comfy and eye-catching and I often get questions like, &#34;where did you get those&#34;?  I don't like them much for running because they feel heavy to me after years running with minimalist shoes.  They are probably right in line with other shoes as far as weight goes so if you run with &#34;regular&#34; shoes then I am sure they would be perfect.
B004ZIT63U PRETTY IN RED I  WOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER MYSELF A &#34;SNEAKER OFFICIATE&#34; I ALWAYS HAVE MORE THEN TWENTY PAIRS IN MY CLOSET AT ANY GIVEN TIME SINCE I WAS 15, I HAVE A HIGH INSTEP AND I FIND THAT ONLY RUNNNING SHOES OFFER ANY REAL SUPPORT. THESE PARTICULAR PUMAS I HAVE WORN  OUT ONLY ONCE SO FAR  (BECAUSE I JUST RECEIVED THEM) AND I GOT FOUR COMPLIMENTS ON THEM ALREADY, TWO OF THEM ASKED ME WHERE I PURCHASED THEM  . THEY ARE EVN BETTER LOOKING IN PERSON THE RED IS SO VIBRANT THEY REMIND ME OF A FIRE ENGINE . THE MATERIAL IS REALLY THICK AND APPEARS DURABLE THE SOLE IS CUSHY THEY PUT A LITTLE BOUNCE IN YOUR STEP.  THEY DO FIT A BIT SNUG IN THE TOE BUT IM HOPING THEY WILL GIVE A LITTLE. IF NOT I'LL HAVE TO SWAP THE INSOLE FOR A THINNER ONE ...BUT THESE SNEAKERS ARE SO EYE CATCHING AND THE PRICE IS SO RIGHT I LOVE THEM ANYWAY.
B004ZIT63U Great value Purchased for my daughter and her comment was &#34;I love these sneakers!&#34;. She says they are very comfortable. Great color too.
B004ZIT63U Favorite sneaker This is the fourth or fifth pair of these sneakers my son has owned over the past few years. He doesn't want anything else. They are very comfortable and wear well. He has a few of the &#34;popular&#34; type sneakers, but complains they are uncomfortable and &#34;aren't good for gym. These are his &#34;go to&#34;sneakers. These were a half size too big (first time ordering on line), so we'll keep them for the next growth spurt, and reorder a different color in a half size smaller.
B004ZITHZC My son calls these his "fast shoes" The little guy has converse sneaks and boots but he likes these best.  Since he can put them on himself and because they are easiest to run in, he calls them his fast shoes.  We have gotten compliments on them because they lopok like really expensive adult runny shoes but i found them to be affordable in his size.  We got the blue and a lot of kids clothes seem to be coming out in electric blue so they match a lot of his &#34;active wear&#34; as well.
B004ZITHZC His Fav &#34;what you know about Rockin' the Velcro&#34; Ha, that is what my 5 year old says about these Pumas/ He loves them and they look sharp with every outfit. Puma is a great durable shoe for any rough playing boy! I have tried them all, trust!
B004ZITHZC My son will not wear any other shoe!! My 7 year old is obsesed with PUMA at the moment and these are very cool.The color is great for a boy and he claims to run &#34;super fast&#34; while wearing them lol
B004ZITHZC It is falling apart after about 6 weeks Looks great! My daughter loves them! I used to buy cheap shoes for her... but then decided to get her this &#34;fancy&#34; pair... she is now 4 years old and would not outgrow the expected life of a &#34;better quality & brand&#34; pair... but both shoes are starting to open on the glued seams after about 6 weeks of use.
B004ZITHZC Just what we needed I bought these for my almost 7 year old daughter who knows how to tie shoelaces but refuses to do so. These shoes just makes our mornings a little less stressful. Although Velcro, the style is still &#34;cool&#34; and my daughter loves them. She says she can run raster and jump higher... :)
B004ZITHZC Very good looking shoes! The shoes fit my wide-foot toddler really well and look super handsome. They look very breathable, soft and they are exactly what I wanted for him to wear when climbing and playing in the playground. They have a &#34;sure fit&#34; insole which can be taken out to measure your child's foot which is nice.
B00517T9UO Pumas' "Blade-like" cleats give great traction, light for speed, and look awesome too! My son is an intense soccer player (11 yo) with crazy speed.  He loves Pumas' &#34;blade-like&#34; design on the cleats for speed and control.  Great color too.  LOVES the neon green.  He's been wearing Pumas for 3 years of competitive soccer, and we're getting new ones for fall 2013.These also helped him be instantly recognizable in his first season in Flag football -- leading the team with 11 touchdowns. :-)A softer leather would be nice, but these plus &#34;Sweet Spots&#34; for extra ball control helped him have his best-scoring soccer season ever -- including 2 hat-tricks.  :-)
B0054KWWQG Still wearing a year later, but not a fan of the price Well, I've had these socks for nearly a year I believe.  The washing machine and dryer have stolen a few, so I think I am down to one pair, but they've lasted without holes.  I'm a size 11.5 in sneakers and ordered the size 10-13 socks, which fit my somewhat narrow foot just fine.They're comfortable and seem good for athletic activity.  I just don't like the price point in comparison to other brands, so I just purchased another brand to replace them.  Quality and price make me feel like they're &#34;okay&#34;, hence my 3-star review.  Maybe I'm just picky.
B005552422 Nice shoes - if you order larger These shoes are quite nice, and have a distinctive look.  The all-black coloring allows these sneakers to be dressed &#34;up&#34; or dressed &#34;down.&#34;  The minimal red accents on the black background &#34;pop.&#34;  It is difficult to tell from the images, but the suede is perforated across the entire shoe, making these practical only in warmer weather.  On the downside, the fit of these sneakers is snug, such that I recommend you order at least a half-size larger than your standard sneaker size.  (I generally wear an 11-11.5, and the Puma size 12 is still a bit snug.)
B005552422 Nice looking and comfortable shoe. I played tennis in these last week and they were great on the indoor courts. I like &#34;old school&#34; sneaks and these look like they came from the 70s. They can be worn with almost anything and don't have the bothersome arch support for people like me who have flat feet.
B0056X0FVK Stylin' workout shoe Needed a cross trainer sneaker for working out.. (Primarily doing my workout DVD's ...Jillian Michael's!!!) Needed something with that medial- lateral stability & these &#34;fit the bill&#34;.  They're very comfortable & pretty true to size but I do need to wear a thin sock. (I'd order a half size up if you like wearing a thick sock.) I'm a first time Puma buyer & will buy them again.
B0057DPSQG Legs seem a little wide for a "small" I love the design and construction on these, but for a &#34;small&#34; the legs seem pretty loose, almost like boxers. This is coming from someone with fairly muscular legs, not little twigs, so usually I'm stuck with the opposite problem. It doesn't both me much, but if you're looking for a close fit around the thighs, look elsewhere.However the waistband fits perfectly. Win some, lose some.
B0057DPSQG Hubby loves it! So do I! My other half used to wear those rough boxer briefs from this famous fruity brand. I always hated the fabric, and they were a little tight around his (strong) thighs.I took it upon myself to buy those Puma. When I asked him about these new boxers he stopped what he was doing and the first words out of his mouth were: &#34;Oh My God!&#34;. They are soft to the touch and fit him just right! What more can you ask for?I am buying more...
B0057DPSQG Great buy I bought these for my BF for Christmas.  I read the other reviews and saw that people noted that these run large.  He is a bigger guy - 6'1&#34; and probably about 230...  He usually would take an XL, but the Large fit him perfectly.  He says they're comfy, too.
B0057DPSQG good Buy me came alive in Venezuela. The product is of very good quality but the size is excessively large. Says size M 32-34 &#34;I'm size 32&#34; and are not me. No I'll do with them are now very large
B0057DPSQG Uncomfortable - But not how you might think... Like many other companies, they decided to make a &#34;tag-less&#34; label for these. That's great. But they made it out of that plasticy vinyl material and it sticks to your hip/butt all day. I actually have to turn these inside out to wear them. It doesn't seem like it would be a big deal, but it is annoying to constantly peel your boxers from your rear. How they missed this during the design phase is beyond me.
B0058XF1V2 Totally love these! They look a bit, umm, &#34;different&#34; but the fit is incredibly comfortable.  Instead of &#34;different&#34; I'm just going to make that &#34;too cool&#34; instead :-)I like them so much, I bought a white pair, too!
B0058XF6Q2 PUMA....PUMA...PUMA! : ) Such a great shoe! Fits perfectly and they look great as well (As judged by the compliments I get). Was mostly a &#34;Speed Cat&#34; guy.......but these looked too good to pass up. Quicker than the 3-5 selected shipping time, I LIKE THAT! Nice carrying bag is included.....nice touch. Highly recommend, thanks Amazon!
B0058XFAMC Awesome Sneakers! I am just a &#34;regular guy&#34; meaning I don't really give much thought to my clothes and footwear.  When I buy clothes and shoes I pretty much go right don the middle....,not too fancy and not too dull.  I am not a &#34;shoe guy&#34;.  However, while strolling through the mall with my wife I saw these red Puma Ferrari sneakers in the window and I knew I had to have them.  Went inside, they had my size, they felt great, I bought them and looked way cool.I cannot tell you how many times strangers have asked me &#34;what kind of shoes are they&#34;, &#34;where did you get those shoes&#34;, &#34;I just love your sneakers&#34; etc.  I've had these sneakers about a year and I bet 40-50 people have commented positively about them.  In 60 years of wearing shoes I cannot recall anybody saying anything about my footwear.  It's kind of weird but I like it.
B0058XFP4A "Black Fancy Shoes" I had to buy a completely black shoe to comply with the dress code at my son's school.  He is very uncomfortable in &#34;Sunday&#34; shoes and they mark him as &#34;incomplete&#34; in gym because he is not wearing sneakers.  Then there is style...and al list goes on.  So I needed to buy a sneaker, in fashion, comfortable, all black  and must satisfy a &#34;tweener&#34; ;and a very strict school dress code. Although these sneaker have grey reflectors, and the puma is also grey it still satisfies the school.  My son loves that they bring him &#34; nice shoes&#34; from his peers. I was hoping to buy more but they have run out of the sizes he can use. Since my son takes extra care of these shoes I can only assume that they are comfortable. He is happy with his shoes.
B0058XFP4A Very nice It is rare for me to purchase shoes online as I always believe when buying shoes you need to see it, touch it, try it etc.I bought this one cause I didnt find it in the stores and it was like a gamble for me, but it turned out a winning hand.It is comfortable though you need to &#34;break it&#34; for some time before you feel it's comfort.Highly recommended
B0058XFP86 Great Shoe!! My son is autistic and never mastered shoe tying. These shoes allow him to &#34;fit in&#34; as a senior in high school. They fit and look great! No complaints!
B0058XFP86 The oder was excellent The Puma shoes were for my husband&#34;s gift.We love them.The size and color were perfect.The order was on time too.Thank you,Marioly Martinez
B0058XFP86 Awesome Shoes I wanted to buy a pair of running sneakers for a long time, and I had been really happy with some &#34;Tergament&#34;  casual shoes I bought from Puma, because they were really light, comfortable and looked pretty cool, until time damaged them off. . I usually buy sport footwear  for basketball and use them for almost eveything. I've been running for a while now, and I needed a lighter shoe, one that  could be used for a long time without my feet getting tired. I chose this product, and I'm pretty satisfied. Not only they are light and comfy,they also look amazing.
B0058XFYDC Classic Styling, Long Break-In Period These shoes draw comments ranging from &#34;I like the style&#34; to &#34;I wanted those back in the day&#34;.  Nice stylingThe problem I had was the heel/tendon area piece digging into the back of my heel, but only on the right shoe.  After a mile walk, the shoe had cut through skin.I worked on breaking the shoes in for a week.  Also, I tugged and bent that area of the shoe until it finally was safe to wear all day.Even after the heel issue, the shoe itself felt stiffer than most others.  This isn't a complaint: it is simply noteworthy.I did have to finish punching the top shoe eyelet on one shoe.  No biggie: again; noteworthyThese are a flat sole shoe, so don't expect major support or adjustment.  They are mostly for the looks.With a month of wear, the shoes have held together and fit fine.
B0058XFYDC Pumas rock! Pt. 2 Big fan of Walt Frazier and his line of Pumas.  How could you not like this great looking sneaker?  They are very comfortable as are all the &#34;Classic&#34; and &#34;Clyde&#34; models.
B0058XGI5A Great looking shoe!! This was a gift for my husband and in his words &#34;I just wanted a PUMA shoe and optimized for the look - and it was exactly what I expected!!&#34;
B0058XGI5A Good fit Many puma shoes i have ordered in the past tend to run &#34;wide&#34;. These have been my favorite out of 5+ pairs i have bought in the past 2 years. Good support for the arch of the foot and comfy.
B0058XGI5A Outstanding quality and comfort. As I've found with most Puma shoes, I ordered them 1/2 size above my normal size and they fit perfectly. I really like the look of these &#34;motorsports&#34; inspired shoes.
B0058XGLKC Great all the way around Good fit, lightweight, perfect for my workouts at the fitness center. I like Puma! Plus, it comes with a &#34;clever little bag&#34; for carrying the shoes!
B0058XGLKC First Pair of Puma Brand I finally got to see what I'v been missing in a shoe. I normally buy NIKE or ADIDAS but this pair of PUMAgility Cross-Training Shoe is definitely &#34;Running&#34; with the big boys. They are stylish, comfortable,lightweight,and affordable. I give them very high marks for overall satisfaction. Great shoe!!
B0058XH4L2 Cute and comfy This is my second pair of these Pumas since I wore out my first pair.  Casual enough to work with jeans and leggings, but also cute enough for slightly dressier occasions.  They have become my &#34;go to&#34; shoe.
B0058XH4L2 Cute and comfy flats These are cute,  comfortable shoes. They run a bit on the small side, more because they are a bit narrow. I wear a 7.5 in most flats,  but I ordered an 8 in these, and the 8 fits well. The colors on the shoe are great. I got the ones that are gray leather with plum (the company calls it &#34;cabernet&#34;) mesh. They have the right amount of color to add a bit of pop, but not so much that they look silly. There is not a lot of padding in the sole, so I do not know how the comfort will be if you are on your feet all day. I will update once I get to wear them for a full workday. So far, so good, though.
B0058XH5D4 I love my shoes! These shoes are awesome! They arrived in plenty of time and fit well! There isn't much &#34;give&#34; in the tongue, but once the shoes are on, they fit like a glove! Wearing them has made the shoes much flexible and they are my current faves!
B0058XH5D4 Great Shoe! I have a really high arch so it's hard for me to find good &#34;work out&#34; shoes, but these are super comfortable and a great price! I bought the same shoe in a different color too.
B0058XH5D4 AMAZING SHOES! These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned! They feel so nice and the quality is amazing! And the color is gorgeous! I've had SO many compliments on these. I don't use them to work out in because I don't want to do anything to speed up the &#34;wearing-out&#34; process. I want to have these for a long time! Every time I wear these I get a compliment. The size I got was perfect, but I definitely recommend trying these on somewhere if you can. I found them here at my local shoe carnival, and they didn't have the size I needed so I tried one that looked very similar just to be sure I ordered the right size. These shoes have a &#34;tongue&#34; but it's built into the shoe (meaning it's sewn into the sides) and because of it you might need a different size than you usually wear. If you can find one similar and try it on, do it! Overall LOVE LOVE these shoes and would recommend to anyone!
B0058XH5D4 Very comfortable, but feet step out of the heal of the shoe... These were extremely comfortable shoes!  They have a very unique &#34;tongue&#34; that is a little snug (built in) and hard to squeeze the foot into the shoe.  I really loved the fit and feel, but when I walked around the house in them, the heals of my feet rose significantly out of the back of the shoe.  I gave them a couple of days on the carpet, but I could tell they wouldn't stay on as well as I needed them to.  I was disappointed, but returned them.  I really wanted them to work, as they were super comfortable all-around.  I did need to order a full size up for a good fit, as most of the other reviews stated.
B0058XH5D4 Perfection. The snug running shoes are my absolute favorite. I used to have &#34;chunkier&#34; nikes, but these are so nice and slim. They're the best running shoes I've ever had, and I felt like I got them for a steal (said nike shoes were around $70 at an outlet)!
B0058XH5D4 Love the Puma Womens Voltaic Running Shoe I love this shoe. I was looking for a shoe that would proivide support and &#34;cush&#34; at the same time. This shoe fits the ticket! PLus, I love the teaberry red & flourescent peach color. Lots of compliments.
B0058XH5PM Shoes Puma Good shoes, and debuts, right size, feel good on my feet, I could not be otherwise if puma, &#34;Puma es Puma&#34;
B0058XHCDM Casual without Looking Clunky It is not an &#34;long walk&#34; sneaker; however, it does offer comfort and fits well.  I wear it to run errands and when I take a short walk.  The shoes has a nice style and it fit me true to size.  Although I have a narrow foot, this shoe is not extremely wide and it worked for me.
B0058XHEBM Quite happy with this purchase! Nice and fashionable shoes, they are comfortable and fit really well, it feels so good when walking, In spite of these are my first &#34;Rome&#34; model I do like this classic model.
B0058XHEBM Very small shoes - like for elf feet Way, way, to narrow. More a 9.5 than a 10.5. Puma should be embarrassed to produce such junk. It seems that many of the major popular shoe companies have failed to establish a unified shoe size. The concept that a shoe &#34;last&#34; is standardized is long gone. Though I have found Ecco to be very consistent in their shoe sizes - a 44 is a 44.
B0058XHEBM Stylish and Comfortable These fit just as well as they look!  However, for me, Puma's tend to be a bit smaller than my &#34;go to&#34; K-Swiss.  So, this time I ordered a half size larger and they fit perfectly.I wear a lot of blue shirts, so the blue stripe / accent really stands out nicely.
B0058XHEBM Cheap non-leather shoes Thought these would be like my previous leather white and blue Roma shoes but the all black version is just a cheap synthetic/vinyl version. The Puma logo tag on the tongue is also all black, not black and white as pictured.While they are a comfortable shoe I feel miss-led by the description. Not sure if this is entirely Amazon's fault as the Puma.com site has the same description. Anyway beware of the &#34;leather&#34;.
B0058XHEBM These are NOT LEATHER shoes I was specifically interested in the Romas because they had a &#34;leather upper for long wear and serious style&#34;.  I ordered the shoes, on sale, from a participating Amazon vendor. My order was shipped and delivered as expected, but when I unwrapped the shoes, they had no leather... anywhere...  and the manufacturer's stickers stated &#34;other materials&#34;.  I called Puma directly and was told that their shoes (as stated on their site) were made of leather and I should try to return them to Amazon for a leather pair.  I did so, thinking maybe a pair directly sourced from Amazon would be leather, as advertised.  I paid full price for the second pair of Romas (Black/NightShade/Orange... not my first color choice, but sourced and shipped directly from Amazon) and they were not leather either.  Very frustrated I called Puma again, and this time was told that the shoes on their site were only leather if they said &#34;Genuine Leather&#34;!  Are you kidding me...?!?!  Talk about advertising that does not accurately represent the product.  Its great if you want to make animal friendly products, but call it what it is... synthetic!  DO NOT ORDER THESE IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT A LEATHER SHOE, YOU WILL RECEIVE &#34;OTHER MATERIAL&#34; SNEAKERS.
B0058XHQN8 shoe scam &#34;the sole of the shoe took off with little use&#34; tremendous scam, for the trouble caused by the sole of the shoe is made &#8203;&#8203;in the trash.
B0058XHQN8 Are these really a running shoe? These shoes came and are slightly less wide than the Puma running shoes I currently wear. They also feel less stable. Inside this shoe is printed &#34;fitness&#34; as opposed to the running shoe I have, which has &#34;running&#34; printed inside of them (this is only my second pair of Pumas, so I'm not sure this is germain). That aside . . . Looking for a shoe that offers great support? Give this pair a pass.
B0058XIVRS Fantastic And stylish shoes.  They fit as expected and get the &#34;oh my gosh I love you shoes&#34; comment every time I wear them!
B0058XJJ88 Comfy, comfy, comfy Got these shoes because of the color and need for good walking shoes. The shoes arrived, and the box read &#34;running shoes.&#34; Totally not being a runner, I was skeptical. Well, they are VERY light weight, flexible, breathable. Wore them on international flight with no problems, and my feet did not hurt at all. They were my go-to shoes when walking endlessly around the city in Europe. Arch support is adequate, which is why I prefer Puma.
B00593GVNI Gotta love em....... These are a great &#34;Summer&#34; buy for this year and I'm not shy to sport these &#34;very&#34; snug fit'n shorts. Just ware with a Thong or go Camando  witch ever is just fine. 8-)
B00594D9E6 They Fall Apart I wish I could give these a better review, because they look pretty cool brand new.  But, the rubber on the soles comes apart from the shoes and &#34;flaps&#34; in about 1 week - seriously.  I've had two pairs (one red, and the other blue), and both did it within 1-2 weeks of normal wear.  Don't buy these.
B00594DXK6 Great Style It is a great style.  I enjoy the brand, this is unique.  It does take some getting &#34;breaking-in.&#34;  I would not exchange or get rid of it however. I like the fit now, even if it's a bit to lace up.  Thanks PUMA.
B00595JOOY Buy 1/2 size up and break them in These are comfortable shoes and can be worn as very casual business casual.  Good to walk around in and made of tough leather.  I can't give them 5 star because I usually wear much more expensive shoes (mostly driver moccasins) which are more comfortable.  However these serve the purpose for which I purchased them and that is to wear around and &#34;beat up on&#34; a little and still look like they have some style.  As the other reviews state, buy 1/2 size larger and they will still be a little snug, but they will stretch and become quite comfortable.  I am considering getting a second pair in black.
B00595JOOY Stylish and comfortable I wear these shoes at the office and the &#34;kids&#34; (the people in their 20's I work with, the ones with the tattoos and the 10 facial piercings) like them, so I must have picked the right pair.  I really like the red stripe on the heel, it's a great design choice.
B00595JOOY SNUG BUT STYLISH..... These shoes are a great &#34; casual dress&#34; shoe...they are very comfortable & soft but snug on my narrow foot...I think they will be okay once they're broken in...if you are wide footed these are not for you...
B00595JOOY Sexy, classy, edgy, awesome. I found these shoes for my husband after he wore his old PUMAs into the ground. The style of his old shoes had been discontinued and these were the closest. He has been wearing them constantly for months, and a couple of weeks ago he asked if I would buy another pair because he likes them so much and he's worried they'll be discontinued by the time he needs new ones. He  called them &#34;the most comfortable shoes I've ever had.&#34;I rarely care about or notice mens' shoes, but these are... sexy! My husband wears them to work where he's on his feet all day. However, he can wear them with almost any outfit. They make jeans look classier, and &#34;classy&#34; clothes look a bit edgier. I should mention that his feet are on the narrower side, so I'm not sure if people with wider feet would find them as comfortable.
B00595JOOY WHAT size?! &#34;A little small&#34; is an understatement. I ordered a full size larger and could BARELY get my foot all the way in, yet the heel was loose. I normally wear a 13, and maybe Pumas don't have this problem in the smaller sizes, but these are RIDICULOUSLY narrow for a 14.
B005ADO2X8 No timer, lap counter, or alarm The watch is very comfortable but does not have &#34;Count-down timer, lap counter, alarm&#34; as advertised.  I've already contacted the seller to bring this to their attention.  I was given a refund for part of the purchase price so I'm satisfied with the customer service but I'm disappointed to see that the description of the product has not changed.
B005ADO31O Great for Vision Issues or Learning to Tell Time My son had a surgery that impaired his vision (not the reason for the surgery obviously).  He needs larger text and needs to start telling time.  This watch is absolutely perfect.  I do wish the digital formation of some of the numbers (say the &#34;2&#34;s) were better, but all in all, it's exactly what we needed.
B005ADO31O Sleek! Super light and super sleek! I love how the Puma lights up when you press the &#34;light&#34; button. The font is nice, big, and easy to read!
B005ADOA6W Nice looking, but not water resistant This watch is very nice looking, but you cannot wear this in the shower or in the swimming pool. It can only get &#34;splashed&#34; in the rain to be safe. Unfortunately I have to return this. Luckily it is eligible for free returns from Amazon. Also, Amazon's price was $10 less than the price of the same watch on Nordstrom.com.
B005ADOBAC Like it I bought this watch for my son and he likes it very much.  Watch was shipped very fast and was exactly as described in the add.  Dial is easy to read and according to him, &#34;very cool&#34;.
B005CBVO02 Slippery laces, could be more comfortable My fourteen year old son has been wearing these for about 6 games or so and says &#34;They're fine. But they could be more comfortable and the laces come untied a lot even when I double knot them.&#34;
B005CKB0WA comfortable shoe My sons feet are wide, and these fit better than I expected! He likes the soles because they are &#34;grippy.&#34;
B005CKB0WA Toddler LOVES them. My almost three year old loves these and thinks they make him &#34;as fast as a puma&#34;. My only caution is they are a narrower shoe (not super narrow, but if your child has a very wide foot it could be snug). All in all happy with my purchase and will probably order the next size once he out grows the 8's.
B005CKB0WA Well made and good price My son claims these shoes make him &#34;really really&#34; fast.  If you'd like for your son to also be &#34;really really&#34; fast, then these are the shoes for you.  They are light, breathable, cleanable, and sturdy.  Perfect kids shoes.
B005CKDW76 Irregular Item Advertised as "New" VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!  The tongue of each shoe is almost an inch too short. The blue/white trim around the toe is poorly sewn and is falling apart... Had my son not worn them, I would have IMMEDIATELY returned the shoes, as they were a complete and total waste of money for a name brand &#34;nice, new&#34; pair of Puma shoes.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!!
B005CKHBP0 great shoes Kids grow out of their shoes really fast. We thought we'd buy the cheaper ones for this reason, thinking we wouldn't spend so much. Hah! The cheaper ones wear out or break too easily. So we went back to Puma. Our daughter used two pairs since she started to walk and they both survived (and have been worn by her little sister). This pair is all that we expected of Puma. It's great for the kids who need the flexibility when they move. It is built well and stands up to their active movements. My daughter loves to run, tip-toe, jump, &#34;do ballet&#34; (pirouette) and still the shoe is holding form and is comfortable for her. My husband was concerned about this one's Velcro, having them both on each side of the shoe; he thinks the straps will eventually tear at the more slender parts. I am not sure I agree, but we'll see. We'll definitely keep buying Puma for the kids (as long as we can afford it anyway :D ).
B005CVWYPG PUMA shoes LOVE THEM, LOVE THEM, LOVE THEM!  Have the best luck with shoes from PUMA.  Hard to find shoes in my size that don't have the &#34;alphabet&#34; on them, or Barbie, or SpongeBob Squarepants.  54 year olds don't look good in shoes that light up!
B005CVY9RW Super cute, but size is not right... Super cute shoes, but I thought the &#34;4&#34; meant the size of the shoe.  It must not because it looks like a really small infant's shoe size...maybe a 4 month old or 6 month old...
B005DIRAFM Oooh, I like that color! The title is this review is exactly what everybody has said when they see my wife in this shirt. She wore this on Christmas day, and if I had a dollar for every time I heard, &#34;oooh, I like that color&#34; I would be able to buy her some Puma shoes to match. This is a very cute top and yes, I like the color.
B005GKXXE4 Coffeetime tastes ver good in milk! My friend has used this product for years and wants to have it regularly--would not be happy if &#34;the house&#34; ever had to be unable to buy another bottle.
B005HEJK3W Runs too narrow. They *look* great, but the &#34;wide&#34; size was way too narrow. If you order them, get a wider size than you normally wear.
B005HELTCM Great buy! LOVE these shoes while playing golf! They are the first comfortable pair I've had. Walked 18 holes the other day and felt like i was walking on air. Leather shoes often don't &#34;give&#34; but these shoes just keep on giving.
B005HENLFA Awesome golf shoes Stylish and comfortable. The &#34;spikes&#34; dont do much but its better than nothing. I have 2 pairs of these. Ive had them covered in mud and they clean up like new.
B005LCD60I Great Shoe Fits true to size.  This shoe is lightweight and a great &#34;summer shoe&#34;.  I would fully recommend this product.  GREAT
B005MA049U Love these shoes for the price I love anything Puma, and when I saw these shoes for the price, I snagged them up. They are light and comfortable. As a seasoned runner, I wouldn't recommend these for &#34;running&#34; as they state &#34;feel the need for speed&#34;; they simply don't have the support or traction for distance running or sprinting. However, these shoes work perfectly for my gym workouts and as casual shoes. I love them!
B005OKY03Y Puma My son's feet had not been able to fit into anything less then a mens 15; or so I thought~ He is really according to the Dr. a 13 EEE, that being said; they had &#34;room to grow&#34; but the size made up for the with; my son loved the sneaker in general; looks, color, comfort.
B005ON39OC Okay.. It has taken quite a few miles to break these in, the back really dug into my ankles.  I don't need any special support, so these were fine in that department...They are very breathable!  I love the mesh - my feet don't get that gross &#34;swamp&#34; feeling in the summer, the con here, though, is if you're running outside or on trails, dirt is more likely to get in there.  The good outweighs the bad.
B005OT1UI8 Weird fit These shoes are super cute, it's too bad they have to be returned.  Purchased in my usual size for my narrow side of medium feet.  They won't stay on!  Tried various liners to make them work but something is just &#34;off&#34; about them.  They fit fine when standing still, but no good for speed walking.  I think the opening is just too large compared to the side height or something.  Then again, perhaps my feet are just too skinny.  They don't seem to be/look wide however.
B005OTA9R6 Puma Janine Dance Fashion Sneaker I really like these shoes. They are comfortable and look nice, either with slacks or jeans. If your foot size is a bit wider than a &#34;B&#34;, then I wouldn't recommend them, as they fit snug to my &#34;B&#34; foot. I did't see where Puma offered this shoe in wider sizes, but perhaps they do, and it just needs further investigation on the customers.I also like that these shoes are available in 1/2 sizes.
B005OTA9R6 I like them because they are light, and the ball under the front makes it easy for me to turn. They are easy to dance in.  I like them for exercising... will use them in my zumba  class... &#34;good fit.&#34;
B005OTA9R6 only good for dance? No arch support and not good for everyday wear. I bought these in a store and they were not advertised as &#34;dancing shoes.&#34; I've had these about 6 months and get sore feet and knees from them. I recommend puma Turins.
B005OTY71U Comfy and fashionable My youngest loves &#34;comfy pants&#34; and these are perfect.  They are washed and worn often and are holding up well.
B005PZ8YXA Beautiful color It will be easy to pick him out on the soccer field wearing this beautiful blue shirt.  When I gave it to him he exclaimed &#34;I love Puma!&#34; Four years old and male and he loves a line of clothing already, or is it the big cat?  True to size, soft cotton and wears well.
B005R4MF8Y Fancy Shoes:) Beautiful, extra light weighted, what my son says &#34;fancy&#34; shoes! Very happy with the purchase. I highly recommend for summer!
B005S0PF1G Adorable and comfy. These are my six year old daughter's &#34;go to&#34; shoes.  She loves how easy they are for her to put on, how comfortable they feel on her feet and that she gets lots of compliments.  They seem to run a little small, so we ordered up a full size and they fit with a little growing room.  A great shoe!  Since it's the only pair she wants to wear now, we're going to get a pair of black ones too.
B005WXOWSG Nice n cool Great watch even cooler when you get it out of the box, has nice engraving on the back &#34;Pole Position&#34; and its comfy as well
B005ZFCUIA Bought for my wife She loves these sneakers. They were uncomfortable for a couple of days, and once her feet &#34;learned&#34; new shoes - she started to wear them everywhere she goes.
B005ZFCUIA Love the fit but... I love the fit of these shoes! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is the &#34;spectrum blue&#34; is really more of a purple. I'm still keeping them though :)
B005ZFCUIA These are waaaayyyyy too cool! Love these shoes. Just started playing  pickleball and these fit the bill perfectly!  Saw a kid playing soccer with this color shoes on and said....&#34;I've got to have that color for playing&#34;!  Very satisfied with the fit and shipping was fast because I'm a Prime member!  Keep up the good work Amazon!
B005ZFCUIA Beautiful athletic shoe! These are very comfortable and stylish.  The coral coloring is absolutely beautiful.  Note:  I listed &#34;fit as expected&#34; but the shoe does run 1/2 size too small.  I was fortunate enough to read a previous buyers' review prior to ordering and ordered a size 8 1/2M instead if an 8M.  The padding does make this smaller but it's also what makes this shoe comfortable and offers much support.
B005ZFCUIA Bye bye Nike, hello Puma's! I can see why some reviewers find them &#34;too small&#34; they're very padded (in a good way) making them fit like a glove. If you want extra room buy half a size up. It's not an uncomfortable tight to me, feels how a shoe should fit. Very very comfortable and good cushioned arch, which is great for my flat feet. I have normal width to my feet, if your feet are wide I would recommend going a size up as well (due to the padding) best shoes I've owned so far!
B005ZFCUIA Color different than in pictures. Wife had me order her these &#34;yellow&#34; shoes because she loves yellow.  Got them in and they actually look more of an orange color. Other than that seems like a decent shoe.  Just be aware if you want a yellow shoe this is NOT yellow as it looks in pics.
B0067LD0B2 Puma Watch Designers Should Work for Rolex Can't tell you how many compliments I get from this and other watches from Puma. Hey Amazon, do I get a referral when I tell them all &#34;less than $60 on Amazon&#34;? :-). That's what I've been telling them.
B006C1FLNW Love this watch!! I love the bright blue color.  I wear it a lot more often than I thought I would...eben when nothing else matches.  I like it so much I also ordered in another color.  It is light on the wrist and I like the feel of the band.  It is not &#34;rubber&#34; and I like that.
B006J7WSEY Comfortable cleats My 6 yo says that these are the &#34;squishiest&#34; cleats that she has ever had.  She's been playing soccer for 3 years now, and these are by far her favorites.  Great price as well!
B006OEY2NC Correct size for me. Some Puma shoes that I have gotten ran a little large.Not these! Just a perfect fit and beautiful shoe.&#34;Half Price&#34; deal on Amazon!
B006OEY2NC Very comfortable I usually wear 10 or 10.5, but found the 10 somewhat small, so I reordered an 11 and that was just right.  The upper is very comfortable and soft, yet gives good support.  The &#34;spikes&#34; are very grippy and I haven't noticed a difference in grip compared with my regular spike shoes
B006OEY2NC perfect shoe Nice wide shoe for comfort- the lifetime cleats are great for never replacing, and going right into restaurant after round.  &#34;PERFECT GOLF SHOE&#34; -
B006OEY2NC NARROW FOR MY FOOT When I received the shoes and tried them on, the shoes were too narrow. Should have ordered &#34;W&#34; but out of stock at the time.sold shoes to a friend instead of returning. He loves them. Wore out a white and black pair, now wearing and shoe in black and orange. Size problem probably in the last the shoe was made on.
B006OEY2NC Comfortable, water-proof and stylish I played several rounds with these in wet and dry conditions and they worked well and kept my feet dry. Obviously it is more possible to &#34;slip&#34; with these in any conditions than a traditional shoe with cleats, but they are a bit more slippery in wet grass than I'd like. If you swing so hard that you &#34;come off the ground&#34;, these may not be ideal for you.  Wet grass seems to clump on the bottoms, but not nearly as much as with cleats. So they are considerably easier to clean after a round.The main advantage is the lack of hassle of changing spikes periodically, a task which I always hated.Like all white shoes, they eventually get some stains from grass which are difficult to remove. Using some regular detergent (like 409) and scrubbing with a brush helps, but it still doesn't restore them to new condition.
B006OEZTU2 Everything I expected! Hi, living in a foreign country, the risks concerning size, etc. were pretty high haha. Fortunately, everything was as expected, size, colour, comfort, etc. A little side note: I play about 4 rounds of golf per week, hence, I need really comfy shoes, which these are.Other details:1) Colour is really &#34;flashy&#34; (can be too much for the traditional type golfers)2) Sole and clamps really comfortable and durable3) Really easy to fit, wear, clean, etc.4) Price is/was great (I bought them on sale =))5) Provide excelent gripI apologize for my English for I live abroad.
B006QNQSV0 Puma ballerina flat Having never worn Puma's before (and not having access to try any on for sizing before I placed my order), I had to guess, and am pretty happy with my choice.  I wear either a 9 or 9.5 in most flats, and went with a 9.5 in this case just to be safe.  The width is good (fairly normal), but it's a bit bigger than I had hoped.  However, I'm glad I didn't go with the 9, solely because I think it would have been too small, and given me blisters.  These shoes are very comfortable, but they do take some time to break in, a day or 2...I wouldn't put them on and wear them all day the first day, is what I'm saying!  I'm on my feet 6+ hours at work, and these have a nice sturdy sole (similar to an actual tennis shoe) for better comfort.  They're not exactly supportive as far as the insole (though it's above and beyond the insole of my other flats) or the actual shoe itself, but it's a &#34;ballerina flat&#34;, what do you expect??  One of my favorite pairs of shoes, by far, I purchased them to wear while walking around Rome, and they were great!
B006QNQSV0 Puma Sneaker Shoe fits good and looks good.  However, due to rubber sole, it's slippery when walking in the rain or on a wet sugrface.  Also, note that description indicates &#34;Black&#34; but it' acutally brown.
B006QOI4L6 very pleased with the "classy-european" sneeker appearance. I ordered half size smaller based on comments in another customer's review.  They feel great without socks, but will be a tad snug with socks. I suggest sticking with your normal athletic style shoe size range.My husband even mentioned that the product was well made and very sporty and, just maybe a little &#34;sexy&#34;  with their jaguar side decal.
B006QOIP88 Great shoe for a good deal I bought these as my &#34;gym shoes&#34; because my regular running one were becoming dirty from use.They fit well, are comfortable to run or weight train in. The style is nice, I've gotten a few compliments on them.Overall, good buy
B006QOJ8PM Good workout shoe I ordered the Puma Tazon 5 Cross training shoe due to the gold box deal price, but was pleasantly surprised when inspecting the shoes upon delivery. I don't particularly like the flashy colors of some &#34;sneakers&#34; and these shoes fit the bill.  I also do not like soles with deep lugs as they easily load up with rocks, dirt, etc so again these shoes fit the bill.  I have worn a 12D size for many years and these shoes fit well by giving me a good half-inch of toe play, but are a little more snug than I am accustomed to.  I will say that after a week or so of use, I have not had any blisters or foot irritation from 4-mile fast walk treadmill workouts and the snug fit does provide good support.  I originally was going to give a 4 star rating, but during this review decided that the product fulfilled my expectations so bumped it to 5 stars.
B006QOJ8PM Product is as expected - Amazon's Pricing - Not! This product was on &#34;special&#34; for one day - and I was not at my PC that day. I tried to get the special pricing- but it was gone.I ordered the shoes anyway at a reasonable but not special price... and about 2 days later they were on sale again!!!  A really disgusting sales tactic - I got caught in a &#34;gotcha&#34;!!
B006QOJ8PM Good stability and cushioning I was used to wearing more &#34;mesh&#34; type shoes with much more breath-ability in the forefoot. These only have a few vent holes, however, it's not a problem. They don't feel too hot. Good stability and cushioning.220lb, I lift weights and do some moderate cardio with these shoes.
B006QOJ8PM Great shoe First time I have purchased a pair of &#34;Puma's&#34; and I love them. The are true size and look slick.
B006QOJ8PM Disappointed Does not fit true to size. Was too small and too narrow. Other issues were a &#34;lump&#34; in the right heel making the shoe very uncomfortable. Gel insoles did not help.Now I remember why I haven't purchased a pair of PUMA's since junior high.
B006QOJ8PM Great looking shoe that feels great Not my first PUMA purchase and definitely not my last.  It fits snugly and is light enough that I don't notice it's there.  It's not approaching the lightness of those barely there shoes but light enough that I don't feel the excess weight on my legs.  Commenting on the size, I read the previous posts where people were suggesting purchasing a half to full size larger than their regular size because of the tight fit.  I say don't do that and just buy your regular size.  This shoe was meant to be snug almost like a second skin.  Mind you I said &#34;snug&#34; not &#34;tight.&#34;  If you're losing feeling in your toes, then yes that tight.  But for me it fits fine without having to size up.  I don't like it when my shoes get those creases from normal use; you know around the toe area where it bends.  The fabric of this shoes doesn't feel like it'll get those creases or at least not as many.  Overall I'm happy: my PUMAs fit well and look good.
B006QOJ8PM Still pretty new, but okay so far. For a cross-trainer, I expected a little more stability, and was a little surprised to see that the cushion does identify it as a &#34;running&#34; shoe.  A little more arch support would be nice, too, but I guess you get what you pay for.
B006QOJ8PM highly recommend Bought this for my husband. He wore it once and said five words &#34;it fits like a boss&#34;. Its everything he looks for in a shoe but didnt expect to get it from puma. Hats off to puma.. great shoe
B006QOK96Y Good shoes, but not my favorite shoes. Received these today and put them on right away for the gym. I have &#34;normal&#34; feet I guess, with rarely any fit issues. These fit just right. I wore them for a &#34;boot camp&#34; workout. Pistols, lunges, etc. were fine, felt stable, no slipping off or rubbing. Good traction. I haven't run in them but they feel good enough to do so comfortably. These would get 5 stars from me if they were as lightweight as my other, retired, shoes which were just about perfect (New Balance WE520 and W890).
B006QP1V9W Choice Please teenagers is very difficult at times, when ordering this item, the decision was I like it I don't like it maybe, etc. Now that the item is here, quote &#34; I told you I made the right choice&#34; Kids,
B006QQ14NY Puma Speed Cat in Dandelion/White/Black I love Puma tennis Shoes, they are normally true to my actual shoe size.  Being disabled with many vascular issues, I was recently diagnosed with Type II Diabetes - insulin dependent (I'm a petite person in height and weight), it is extremely difficult to find and then purchase any shoe(s) that isn't heavy or have a heel higher (owe I do miss my high heels at 5'1&#34; tall) than 1-1/2 inches, it just no fun.  But buying Puma's through their outlet, Amazon; or other authorized stores; and then only if they are on sale, it is a wonderful day.  That old saying, &#34;...having your cake and eating too....&#34;, I CAN'T have cake, I CAN'T eat it either. At least I can satisfy my sweet tooth a wee bit by being able to purchase most of my Puma's from Amazon. Yes, I'm a collector (blessed with 6 pair so far) of Puma tennis shoes, if I can find the style I like and if they are on sale (a good sale).  When ever I wear any of my Puma's, I always get compliments, when I ware the bright yellow Puma's, people actually stopped me and complimented me on this particular style and color choice.  They are a wonderful fit; feel; and seem to literally weigh just ounces.
B006QQ1C5E GOOD CONSTRUCTION, FAIR COMFORT They're well put together and the Velcro system makes &#34;tying&#34; them much easier than shoe laces (which is why I tried them). My major complaint was the narrowing of the toe area made them a little tight in that area, at least for me as I have a broad foot. I previously have had a similar shoe from Prophet which has much more room in the toe area and have decided to get another pair of those so I returned the Pumas.
B006QQI3ZQ Returned for color I feel like these shoes looked darker in the online picture. I got them and they looked too much like &#34;old man&#34; grey shoes.
B006QXPZT6 Great for a lean, tall guy! After trying a couple of pairs by other makers that were too short for my son's 6'1&#34; frame, I tried these in small and finally found ones long enough for a thin 6'1&#34; teen.  Written by a grateful mom!
B006QXPZT6 Puma es Puma I like puma because it combines quality and good price, size according to what is shown, excellent material, as we say here &#34;puma es puma&#34;
B006QXPZT6 We love Puma My husband loves Puma, very nice quality. He is 6' 1&#34;, so I had to hem them up approx 1.25&#34;.The all around fit is perfect, no saggy or bulky/puffy looking crotch like some of the other athletic wear fits.
B006QXPZT6 Great fit I bought these for my husband for Christmas, he is 6'3&#34; and the large fit perfectly. They look fantastic on him!
B006SZ5QXW Have every PUMA Bubble Gum watch My husband is obsessed with these watches and as of Christmas, he has five &#8212; lime green, red, blue, gray and white. They are comfortable, affordable and he is always getting compliments. He's a pediatrician at the children's hospital so he always wears scrubs. These watches are the only thing he &#34;changes up&#34; in his outfit and they are extremely comfortable at his job. Plus, the kids love the bright ones! Stop hesitating and buy this watch. Some companies sell them in the upwards of $60-100+ and I'm not sure why. I've always purchased them for $30-$40 here on Amazon.
B006SZ64BA NOT WATER RESISTANT This stated it was 5ATM; which you should be able to use in water. But it is only resistant to &#34;washing hands, raining and splashes&#34;. Bummer. Cute watch though. Everything else was as described.
B006SZ64BA Bigger than i expected I have decided to keep the watch, but it is much bigger than I expected.  I wouldn't call it a &#34;women's&#34; watch due to the size.  If I had seen it in a store, I wouldn't have purchased it.
B006VWJSL8 Great Track Jacket Bought this track jacket to add to my already enormous collection of track jackets.  It really does look great.  I get question like &#34;where did you buy this?&#34; all the time.
B006VYGLHA In love My daughter fell in love, so much so that i had to keep them even though they were clearly too big. &#34;They will fit next year&#34; she saysShe even wanted to wear them to big. I was going to exchange them, but already showing unavailable. I'll keep them. She will grow into them. I didn't know they made noises untill we got them. BONUS
B006WDOIEI Everyone likes this shoe I get loads of women saying they love this shoe, and where did I get it? I think the color is really pleasing and it's a minimal profile for a &#34;running shoe&#34;. It is actually a fashion sneaker, but I would definitely take it to the gym for walking and working out.
B006WEI3BQ Nice shoe, for fashion.. not running! These are too cute... I love pairing them with skinny jeans when I want a casual sporty look... I usually wear heals and these are a very fashionable &#34;dress down&#34; shoe... They aren&#8217;t for running though... they don&#8217;t provide the support for that
B006WEI3BQ Cute These sneakers are really cute. They're definitely a &#34;fashion&#34; sneaker, would not be comfortable for running, or even a lot of walking. there's not a lot of cushion at the bottom. Luckily, I have a strong aversion to exercise, so the cuteness factor of these earns them 5 stars
B006WO90Q8 "Hey! Nice Shoes" I have worn these twice so far - once around the house and once to work. People have commented on them constantly which is pretty cool I guess. They really are a nice-looking shoe.I am used to Pumas and they are my choice for casual sneakers. Pumas can sometimes fit a bit narrow for me.But these are nice and comfortable - for the most part.I've noticed something a bit odd with my pair: the left shoe feels much different than the right.You can see in the product photos the bottom of the shoe has black pads. The ball of my right foot feels like it rests ON the pad, while the left foot feels like it rests in BETWEEN pads - a very awkward feeling when walking.I will probably keep these as I will tell myself they just need to be &#34;broken in&#34;. They are comfortable otherwise and look pretty sharp. That's apparently good enough for me!
B006WORPAG Great sporty looking shoe These are great shoes my girlfriend bought for me for my birthday because I didn't have a pair of &#34;cool&#34; sneakers, just my running shoes.So far so good been wearing them for a week no issues. For the earth lovers these ship in a canvas bag and not a typical shoebox.
B006WTGWZU Perhaps not the most kid friendly. My wife and I love these shoes for my kid. We like that old 80's hip-hop aesthetic. My son prefers his Nike Free Trainers better, and I understand as they perform better for someone engaged in running about. He likes the look, but he considers them to be more of a &#34;dress up&#34; shoe than an everyday choice. Puma makes a solid shoe, I had a pair of Liga's myself for indoor soccer and loved them for casual wear. However, if you are looking for something for your child and he or she is very active you might want to try another style or brand.
B006ZNNYPE Pretty good My husband seemed pleased with them, though I think they looked a little &#34;cheaper&#34; or &#34;loud&#34; than he expected. The white bottom area, especially on the inside is pretty shiny. He says they fit and feel great though.
B00712KP4G Adorable I have never been a &#34;shoe&#34; person but for some reason I love buying shoes for my little people. These are adorable and even in kindergarten his friends give him shoe compliments haha.
B00712KP4G narrow They are quite narrow in my opinion. My 5 year old loves them though. She particularly loves all the &#34;spikes&#34; on the bottom.
B0071BW9KK Great for Zumba! Straight out the box to Zumba for an hour. AWESOME!!!! Feel so lightweight in the hand that I was doubtful of their functionality. However, as soon as I slipped them on my feet I felt fabulous arch support. The toes are slightly &#34;sticky&#34; in a good way for gripping the floor for lunges etc. The little pivot ball is fab for the myriad turns in Zumba. So comfy I could wear these for street shoes. Lots of room in toe box for even my wide feet. And you CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE!!! What a great shoe at great price!!!! No issues with rubbing anywhere on my feet. Wore with ankle sox. LOVE THESE SHOES!!!!
B00721FXXE Velcro does not stay As others on here have mentioned, this shoe &#34;looks&#34; very nice... however, looks is not enough! It needs to be able hold up. My son can not walk in them without the Velcro coming undone (if you can even get it to stick in the first place...). The result is that he ends up walking with too much pressure on the insides of his feet, causing his feet to go inward... So that there is no permanent damage to his feet or the way he walks, I had to purchase new shoes...
B00721FXXE Pumas These are so cute!  They look just like the ones for &#34;big kids&#34; and that is just what my niece wanted.
B0073FRPX0 Don't think Puma always right I rated after I use it for four months. I used to buy things after reviews but this faas 900 was new on market that time. I bought just for lifestyle and fashion so no hard work have been done. In the very first two days, cracks start to appear on the sole. Two months after, the sole starts losing color. I don't know how long it will take to surrender its &#34;sleek look&#34;. From now on, I will think twice before buying Puma products.
B0073G9NNO Great Track Shoes! I bought these for my son for track and he really loves them. First the color is amazing and matched his school colors great. They also came with top quality cleat spikes that are easily removable with the tool that was provided. Second they fit perfect and have the great &#34;second skin&#34; fit that you really want in a track shoe. Great brand, will definitely order this product or similar in the future.
B0073IR6PE Unique I consider these shoes to be unique simply because I have never before found a shoe that combines style, support, and a &#34;sporty&#34; feel. Let's be honest, if you care about your feet and your ankles, you should never buy footwear that does not offer adequate support. I have rolled my ankles too many times in the past, so now I need to be pickier with my shoe selection, but I don't want to sacrifice style. This shoe is the first that I have found that really offers it all.The first thing that you will notice is that they are so lightweight. If you have to take off and run for the bus at the drop of a hat, you won't feel clunky or awkward running in these. They really feel like running shoes and you can definitely use them as running shoes even though they are high tops.I gave these shoes 5 stars, although I cannot tell you yet how durable they are yet. I can tell you that they feel solidly built considering how light they are. Also, even though I gave these shoes 5 stars, not all feet are the same and I feel like I took a big risk ordering these without having tried them on beforehand. These shoes are for slightly narrower, longer feet. My feet are a little wider and shorter than average, but these still feel great even though the fit isn't &#34;perfect&#34;. I bought a D and I'm not sure if E sizes are available. Either way, I'm happy with these and I will not be looking to change them. I still give these a 5 no matter what. If you're into the high top look but want to have the running show feel, you NEED to at least give these a try.
B0073XIITC Uncomfortable I'm pretty picky about shoes and these are very heavy & stiff. I ended up getting rid of them after trying to &#34;break them in&#34; for a few weeks.
B0073XIITC And it's a big, big win for Amazon Reviewers! They fit!  They actually fit.  Except for being loose in the heel, which ALL shoes are on me these days, they fit perfectly.I never know what size to order in shoes.  I thought it was because I was getting older and could no longer fit in my lifelong 7 1/2.  Maybe that's it, but I'm now more inclined to think that various  manufacturers make up their own size standards and leave us guessing.  They want us in the shoe store, maybe?So this time I ran an experiment.  These $62-$79 shoes were in a special sale for $38.  I went to the site and read all the reviews, paying attention to (and &#34;liking&#34;) only those that discussed size and fit.  I then compared what they were saying to what my experiences have been and what sizes I have worn.I ordered 8 1/2 M, bigger than I've ever worn before (Nike is always 8.), and guess what?Yup.  Perfect fit!  I love you all, and thank you.  I am revealing the &#34;Amazon Review Shopping Method&#34; here only.  Bless you!
B0077BXRKK Nice Looks very good and the &#34;disc&#34; shoe lace is different and very attractive. Lot of people envy me about this shoe.
B0077CLM2E You get what you pay for. Arrived promptly and nicely packaged. I had shoes like this &#34;back in the day.&#34; The shoe fit fine but the quality is not what it used to be. For the price though I can't complain.
B007A7TFF2 perfect light summer cap I've been going through chemo, and hate the ridiculous looking wraps and &#34;hats&#34; for that issue. I prefer looking my age, not like a crypt keeper thank you very much.  This cap is cute, light for warm weather, and I will still wear it when my hair grows back!
B007IW951S I love, love, love this sneaker I was looking for an affordable workout shoes for crossfit.  Whenever I would google Crossfit, there were no search results.  But I found out &#34;How they look&#34; from our instructor at our Crossfit gym.  Basically they have to be straight at bottom and should not have any arc.  But the prices were very high and I could not afford to pay over $70 to pay for workout shoes.I am so happy that Amazon kept on updating me about the prices.  I was finally able to purchase this shoes for such an affordable price.And believe me ladies, I can squad much  better than before.  It does give me more balance and control!
B007IWKBK2 Review These are the cutest shoes ever!  Don't know yet how they'll hold up to real use (running, walking, everyday wear) - they don't look as sturdy as most &#34;sneakers&#34; - but I'm happy with them.  Will wear them all fall and winter.
B007J5ANLU Amazing Kicks!!!! I needed some shoes/boots for work.  I wanted a boot, but wanted something light.  I was going to go with some Nike Air Max, and sooo glad I got the Puma's!!  These are featherlight, and they are definitely wider than Nike's and Reebok's. The sewed in &#34;bootie&#34; stretches easily to get them on, then they combined with the elastic lock laces snuggly support the foot.  I'm getting another pair!
B007J5K734 Not wide enough for me. I had hope these would be the &#34;all day comfort&#34; shoe I have been looking for but still look cute. They are cute but unfortunately not comfortable. They are so tight across the instep I could not get my foot in the shoe. I had ordered a size up also! I had high hopes but alas no luck on this pair :/
B007MAYD2C Super cute shoes These shoes are very cute.  My 3yr old loves that they are &#34;sparkly&#34; I like the PUMA shoes because they are low profile instead of clunky like some tennis shoes.
B007MAYD2C Just great My 2-year old daughter just loved the color and the &#34;sparkles&#34;!She tells that she is wearing a princess shoes, because of the bright!
B007MCNU7O the speedometer does not display a number I mistakenly thought this shoe would display, in numbers, how fast your child is going, so I bought it based on that.  However, when I received the shoes, it only displays by &#34;bars&#34; on the side of the shoe how fast your child is running.  Since my kids are into measuring and comparing their speed relative to their friends, the lack of an actual quantifiable speed on this shoe is disappointing.  I will have to return these shoes.  Otherwise, the shoes look good and are a bright blue.  Just wish they displayed the actual speed, ie. feet per minute.
B007P4L4L8 Boyfriend loves them. He has these in two colors.  He is 6'3&#34; and the length is perfect, almost a bit too long, but he's happy.
B007P5YXOC Its too big on me Its okay for the gym,..the colors are  bright.. but its not meant for a size 0-1, 5'3&#34; girl with a tiny waist
B007Q36ALC Look good and fit well! The velcro has started to fray pretty quickly, but other than that they look good and fit my son well. There is a Japanese brand that I prefer to Puma, but I mainly bought these as they look good and are pretty &#34;cool&#34;!
B007SM2M2W Plastic Cover Over Glitter Peeling Upon Receiving New When I received these shoes they looked extremely &#34;dusty&#34; and I realized that it was the plastic covering over the glitter seemed to be separating from the shoe and the result was that they  looked very worn in some areas, mainly on the tips of toes/sides . I had read a few reviews that hinted that this happened but thought we'd give them a try as my child loved them so much. Pretty disappointing to see such poor quality from such a great company like Puma. We returned them and went for a different style.
B007SM2M2W cute but poor quality good fit and daughter likes them but the sparkle &#34;fabric&#34; of the shoe has permanently creased across the top after just a few wears and I think it looks cheap like plastic.  It looks like it might crack soon as another reviewer mentioned.  I would pass on these shoes.
B007TH1UYC Big sole and "puffy" material on the upper The sole is thick and the shoe may fit snuggly but the material &#34;puffs&#34; out, losing that sleel look I prefer.They were well made but lok bulky when worn.
B007UXEW0Y Great fit and comfort, bad construction I'm so torn with these shoes. I love the look, and the support and comfort is incredible. However, the construction of the shoe is done poorly. The material near the big toes looks like it may rip and become a hole at anytime, and the plastic &#34;lip&#34; at the very front of the shoe is already coming detached after one use. It's really disappointing because these shoes are the most comfortable pair I've ever had from Puma so far, and the cushioning inside really gives me the support I need. I didn't have a choice to return them because I received them right before leaving the country, but I'm undecided if I would have or not. I'm not sure how long they're going to last, so I wouldn't buy them unless you can find them discounted more.
B007WQGKQI Beautiful and light. Boots are beautiful and feel well made. They fit as expected, though do require a bit of &#34;wearing in&#34; in the wider part of the foot.
B007WQH3GE Decent fit, fell apart the third time I wore them. Pros: Good fit, leather upper has a good feel on the ball, grippy soles.Cons: Upper separated from the sole during a game the third time I wore them, not just a little separation but all the way from toe to mid foot about 1.5&#34; to 2&#34; deep on the primary kicking foot, making it very difficult to use the shoe anymore.
B0084D5AWS Perfect for the dead of winter in Abu Dhabi! On par with the quality that one would expect from Puma. Light weight for cool not cold days.This with a windbreaker, would be great down to 50F no problem.Keep in mind we're from WY, so our &#34;cool&#34; might not be your cool.
B0089TIZ56 AWESOME & STYLISH WATCH!! This was a &#34;just because&#34; gift and my husband LOVED IT! It's sporty and makes a statement when he wears it. Great quality and unique styling. Just note that the &#34;winder&#34; is on the OTHER side of the watch (it's supposed to be!). My only complaint is the cheap box it came in. It didn't close very well and was cardboard.
B008A64X0Y Love, love. Cute, comfortable and light but enough support to keep you going! My &#34;go-to&#34; shoes for running errands, shopping, outdoor social events where you want something a bit dressier than tennies.
B008A6BB9U I call it my King Koopa shoes! I was looking for cheap, cute and easy to wear shoes. These are surprisingly comfortable. I used to buy chunky heavy running shoes because I thought they provided better support. They did but it they were heavy and bulky. These crosstraining shoes from Puma were a gamble and they are comfortable, easy to wear, look fresh (Ive gotten many compliments), my feet can &#34;breathe&#34; in them. I walk a lot at work and I have no aches at the end of the day. For the price $45 they are worth it.
B008A6C4RS BEAUTIFUL SNEAKER IF YOU COULD CALL A SNEAKER &#34;BEAUTIFUL&#34; THEN THIS IS THE ONE.  RICH NAVY BLUE/PART PATENT LEATHER MAKE IT SNAZZY!!
B008A6JWU0 cheap looking. It's one thing to buy an inexpensive shoe, but it should not scream &#34;CHEAP&#34; on my feet. It was just too plasticky looking. Not for me.
B008A6JWU0 Comfy Everyday shoe Not for athletic activities by any means....I bought these just for scooting around when I don't want to wear flip flops.  They are super comfy - probably run narrow though as I have a narrow foot and when I pulled these out of the box I thought they looked rather &#34;long&#34;.  However, they are stretchy and form fitting.  Just love the way they look with shorts, jeans whatever.
B008A6KTKC LOVE these. These shoes are SO comfortable. They really do &#34;breathe&#34; as advertised. My feet don't get sore at ALL and I do all kinds of work outs. Cardio, aerobics, lifting, and more. I want more pairs just for more colors. ;)
B008A6KTKC PUMA Women's Voltaic 4 GT It's a narrow shoe (to be expected w/ Pumas), comfortable w/ normal support / cushion and great design. It felt a little &#34;high&#34; on the heel portion but I think it's a matter of me getting used to it coming from Asics and Brooks.  I only wore it three times because I found it to be very warm during summer time. I am putting it aside for now until the weather cools a bit.I would not recommend it for wide feet though.
B008A6KTKC Very happy with these running shoes When I first put the shoe on I thought the toe box might be too wide, but when I run my toes spread out so I find the fit really comfortable. I have super high arches and these are very comfortable shoes. If you don't want to &#34;feel the road&#34; at all these shows might not be for you.Love the color!
B008A6KTKC I love the look and style but....... I could not get my foot in with the tong that is attached to the side of the sneaker.  I tried pulling it and struggling with it... I am 65 years old and can't struggle just to put them on... If the tong were separate from the sneaker I think they may have gotten in... but I was not going to get a bigger size then i have another issue.&#34;to big&#34;Let me know when that style of tong changes!!
B008A6KTKC Love them!!!! I have had pumas in the past and loved them, so I decided to try these. My other ones ran small, so I automatically ordered a half size bigger than what I normally wear. These have a wider toe bed compared to my other ones, and I find them to be very comfortable!!  I work in the medical field and am on my feet all day. These are comfortable all day long! The colors are bright, so if you don't want them to be noticed they are not for you! I have received many compliments, and a few &#34; wow, your shoes are bright&#34;. Very pleased with my purchase! I may just have to order another pair in different colors!! Thanks amazon, for another great, smooth purchase!
B008A6KTKC MODERN SHOES !!!! A beutiful running shoes. Modern !!!!!Comfortable. True as size.BEAUTIFULL !!!!Since I put it all my friends look and said &#34;genial shoes!!!&#34;
B008A6KTKC Amazing! As soon as I opened the box, I fell in LOVE with these!  The colors are very true to the photo shown and they seem to be very well made (as with most Puma products).  Normally I have a break in period for new shoes, but these felt great right out of the box.  One thing that I didn't notice in the photos that I love is that instead of having a &#34;tongue&#34; like a normal shoes, these have mesh that go around your foot, similar to water shoes.  You could probably get away with taking the laces off if you're a slide-on, slide-off person.  The box came with a red re-usable cloth bag over the top that my 6 year old snatched up right away... I only had time to read a little of the eco-friendly message that was on it, but I'm very happy to see that big brands like Puma are putting some thought into eco-friendly products!  I can tell these will last me a good while and I love how comfy they are.  If only I didn't have to wear business attire to work... I would live in these!
B008A6KTKC Puma Women's Voltaic 4 Mesh Cross-Training Shoe I was disappointed with this PUMA shoe.  The on-line description/write-up stated it gave support for those of us with flatter arches.  Upon trying these on, it did not give any additional support in the arch.  Also, the back of the shoe allowed my heel to slip right out -- although it was my size.  There was no support to keeping my heel in the shoe.  I also took note upon receiving the product that it was not a &#34;Voltaic 4 Mesh Cross-Training Shoe&#34; but instead stated it was a PUMA &#34;Wade Running Shoe.&#34;  The shoe was identical to what was shown in the picture -- but online definition of shoe was way off.  I returned this product immediately.  I think it's best to purchase this type product in the store so you can try it on -- versus online, unless, you don't mind going through the process of returning a product.  Amazon is great at doing quick and concise return transactions, as long as you provide them with all necessary information.
B008A6KTKC So disappointed! I had such high hopes for this shoe after I read its review on a zumba website. I purchased these shoes specifically for my zumba class. I should have paid more attention to the Amazon customer reviews instead. The shoes are actually darker gray than in the online photo. Which was not bad. I actually liked the darker gray better than in the digital photo. These shoes go on &#34;weird&#34;. They are tighter on the front and middle of your foot. You kind of have to &#34;shove&#34; your foot into the shoe. Possibly because of the attached shoe tongue? However, once I got the shoe on, I have to say --- these are the ODDEST FITTING athletic shoes I have ever owned. TIght and snug from the front and throughout the middle, but then my heel was loose. VERY loose. Like slipping around the back of the shoe and often LIFTING OUT of the shoe. Like my headline says, I am VERY disappointed and am sending them back. Have never had this problem with any of my other athletic shoes before. Guess I need to stick to ADIDAS, Nike and New Balance instead.
B008A6KTKC Great support, lightweight shoe that is perfect for crosstraining I workout mostly indoors and this shoe is perfect for what I wanted.  It's lightweight, but has great support (I like minimalist shoes for outdoor hiking).  The sole isn't too &#34;busy&#34; with laced cushioning which tends to throw me off blance and I like that this shoe has a slightly fitted elastic collar which is great as so many shoes that neck loses its support.  Awesome color!
B008A6KTKC Great colors The color is as bright and contrasting as it appeared in photos.  I noticed some reviews indicated the &#34;attached tongue&#34; as a negative but it isn't for me ~ no sideways tongue to deal with.  They are a comfortable shoe - I do miles of walking in them.  I have gotten many compliments on the shoes - they do attract attention because of the bright colors.
B008A6KTKC Good Shoe but... The shoe has great cushioning, feels good when running, but the fit is slightly short and they don't &#34;breathe&#34; well as compared to another brand that I wear.  However they are a good cross-training shoe.
B008A6KTKC Love love love I absolutely LOVE these shoes! They are so comfortable and have completely change my thoughts on &#34;sneakers&#34;. I originally bought these just to wear at the gym but I liked them way too much and now I wear them all the time! The fit is great and I love how there isnt a &#34;tounge&#34;.  Perfect for working out or running errands, I might even buy another pair in a different color!
B008A6KTKC Gorgeous shoe/felt like it was suffocating my foot Had to return this outwardly gorgeous shoe.  LOVED the way it look but, despite it's appropriate length, it felt like my forefront was all &#34;boxed in.&#34;  It made my toes feel like they were going numb.  I had to return them, sadly.
B008A6YAFW Always Pleased with Puma I'm happy with these shoes. They look as depicted, fit well, and stay laced without a problem. I wouldn't consider these &#34;active&#34; shoes; the bottom feels very flat and rigid. I have worn them in spurts of time -- an hour to many hours -- without feeling uncomfortable, but I certainly wouldn't want them on my feet 24/7.
B008A6YCRI nice cleats My daughter loves these. I am expecting better handling and more &#34;breathing&#34;. They look like they will hold up well. Definitely give these a thumbs up.
B008AH39YE Go Up 2 sizes! My granddaughter wears a 3T so when I ordered I got a size 4.  It fits her just right and I wanted a little growing room plus the jacket said &#34;boys size 4&#34;.  It's nice material but I should have gone up 2 sizes.
B008AILK7Q Not so much Not a big fan of this shoe. It runs small compared to my other pumas. And when they say &#34;lite&#34; they really mean it. But not in a good way, the fabric is barely there and there are holes in the bottom of the shoe. That's just a little too airy for me.
B008AJLUG6 She loves these &#34;FANTASTIC! BEST SOCKS EVER!FIT PERFECTLY AND VERY WARM WITHOUT BEING SUPER THICK&#34;Will buy again when she needs some fresh pairs
B008AJZ5OO Look at it. Need I say more? I'm a Louisville Cardinal fan so I like black with red trim. But once I saw these, I said; &#34;that will do&#34;. Puma has super gear and good prices.
B008AL4BLU Puma Drift Cat 4. This is a light weight top quality constructed shoe that is the coolest ever.  I bought one full size larger than normal and it fits just great and is unexpectedly comfortable.  The Drift Cat 4 deserves top billing in the &#34;must have&#34; category.  Thank you, PUMA.
B008ALMBVM Not bad overall Arrived as expected, they look great. Still a little narrower than I was hoping for, hopefully they fit better after few weeks. They did have a small blemish on the outside of my left shoe about .250&#34; x 1&#34; inch long but I didn't mind so I wore them to my outdoor game. Felt good when striking the ball, another game this week then tournament this weekend. Hope they start to feel wider...
B008ALWDZG son loves them My son is not &#34;flashy&#34; and was not interested in neon cleats for soccer. These are nice leather and understated but still cool.
B008ALX6SO Rcvd In Time for the Tournament I rcvd the shoes sooner than expected. They fit as advertised. They exceeded my expectations given that they don't have the classic &#34;cleat&#34; setup. I have occasion to play on dirt, grass and astroturf. The tournament had a combo of grass and dirt and my footing was never in question. Agai, I was slightly concerned about the cleat design, but I had zero problems with these. Would most definitely buy again.
B008ALXEBS Nice "Boots" For a Nice Price Bought the Puma soccer &#34;boots&#34; for my son, now he uses them everyday after school and he says he's loving them.
B008AWU21W On the narrow side These are nice shoes, reasonably priced, but they were narrower than I expected.  My son's feet are not super wide or anything - most &#34;medium&#34; shoes fit just fine, but the 9.5 D, while long enough, pinched across the base of the toes.
B008AWW7Y2 Narrow its the lightest and most &#34;breathable&#34; pair of shoes I have tried so far. but the only defect i found is that they are slightly narrow. Still fit to perfection
B008AXTOQ0 great fit, good for running, fun colour Good arch support (I have high arches)Springy heelNo tongue!  I hadn't thought about it before I wore these, but the tongues on shoes constantly slip to one side and have to be adjusted.  On these shoes, the &#34;tongue&#34; is fully integrated with the rest of the shoe -- it continues around to the back of the heel and is attached to the side of the shoe from the heel to the toe.  It feels like putting on a slipper, which then gives your a foot an all-over gentle hug.
B008AXTOQ0 Very comfortable...and definitely get noticed! Great price for a nice shoe.  They are MUCH brighter than the picture would suggest and I get compliments on them every time I put them on my feet...lol.  The only thing I didn't like about them is getting them on...there isn't much &#34;elastic&#34; on the mesh intersole so you have to work your foot into the shoe...even when the shoe strings undone.  I should also mention that they are much more heavier than a typical running shoe so I rarely wear them for running...more so for looking stylish in the gym.
B008AXTOQ0 Puma is batting 1000 I don't know why it is, but I am loving Pumas lately.Not only the look, but the way they feel.  I work out 5-days a week, mixed cardio and super sets ... and I play rugby (not in these, in cleats).  Sometimes it's hard to find a shoe to fit my wide &#34;swimming flipper&#34; like feet.But you know what they say about a guy with big feet?He buys Pumas.(smile)
B008AXTOQ0 Good Shoe! Nice lightweight, cool shoe.  I like the &#34;tongue-less&#34; design.  Considering more pairs in different colors.  Note: I think it does fit a little snugger than other Puma shoes I own, so I would recommend a half-size larger when purchasing.
B008AXTOQ0 Awesome Seahawks Colors Both my husband and son got these shoes and they really like them.  Got the &#34;bungee&#34; laces for my son who hates to tie shoes; they came in the perfect lime green.  Happy to wear them and show 12th-Man Pride!!
B008AXTOQ0 Voltiacs Great shoe. I didn't wanna rate them as fitting &#34;small&#34; but they're a bit snug, i think it's because the way they're constructed with elastic ankle/tongue opening (you can't just slip them on, you have to pull them on w/the lil leashes).  I've put about 15 miles on them and lifted in them several times (great for lifting) and they seam to be breaking in nicely.  Quality-outstanding.  I'm proud to show them off, Puma's are very cool looking shoes, in my opinion.
B008AXTOQ0 Nice shoes The &#34;Cherry Tomato&#34; color is definitely not cherry or how they appear in the picture. These are very bright orange - if you have ever seen the cleats Brandon Marshall wears for the Chicago Bears then expect similar! I still like them, just not what I had expected. Shoes are very comfortable. Expect the fit to be snug as these are training shoes. Overall good shoe - just be aware of the color!
B008AXTOQ0 Sizing is a real puzzle here... First pair of Pumas. I ordered a pair of these in black/gold, and after having read all of the reviews advising to &#34;order up&#34; a half size at least, I went with size 10 (men's), even though I normally buy size 9.5 shoes. The pair that I received were nice and snug in width, but felt at least a full size too long. Now I am unsure whether to try a 9.5, or to just try a different type of shoe. I intensely dislike shoes being too long (tripping hazard) more than almost anything else, but I am concerned that if I go much smaller, they may be too narrow. (I do not have wide feet, BTW.)On the plus side, these Voltaics are very nice looking and seem comfortable, although I have not actually taken them out for a run due to the sizing/return issue. It seems like a fine model of shoe, but beware that the &#34;runs small&#34; sizing only refers to width. They are not small in length.
B008AXTOQ0 Look nice The &#34;no tongue&#34; inner lining is a great idea. Sadly, for me, this causes a looser fit, allowing my socks to slip in the shoe no matter how tight I tie it. Also, these are a little heavier than my other running shoes. They look real nice though (as usual for pumas)
B008AXTOQ0 comfortable and bright I chose the bright color due to being in the desert. Great for running. Only thing i would advise is that if you have &#34;wider&#34; feet, be careful with these, they were tight on the sides. Length wise fit as expected.
B008AXTOQ0 Great Shoes These shoes fit like a glove and are extremely comfortable(I wear size 14, and finding well fitting 14s can be a chore).  They have quickly become my &#34;go to&#34; sneaks.  I'm not a huge fan of the 'no tongue' design...but I am liking it the more I become accustomed to it.  The quality is great, although one of the fabric heel pulls is  shredding rather quickly, it is not a concern to me because I typically don't use them anyway and a quick snip of some scissors removes the threads.With me mentioning some downsides why did I rate 5 stars?  because I really do love the fit/feel/look of these shoes THAT much.
B008AXTOQ0 Great Shoe, for Movers & Shakers :-) It a form-fit &#34;running/walking shoe&#34; Simple as that... In fact, I'm leaning towards the Walking side, because let's face it there are better Running, 5k/Marathon etc. shoes @ 3-4 times the money! But, these PUMA's are wonderfully built, attractive, and (again) form-fit functional. Wide feet, need not apply. And you don't linger around in them, when you're off your feet, mine R off:)
B008AXY38Y good shoes after reading the reviews on the shoes and wearing other brands in the past such as new balance, nike, reebok, and adidas. the shoes fit a little more snug than i expected. very good thing i ordered a half size bigger than i wear. other reviews said the shoes fit exactly the way they thought. no one said to get a size bigger. new balance shoes fit a wider foot, reebok and addidas has a &#34;cheaper&#34; quality to them when comparing them to nike, which is my brrand of choice. first time puma owner here and i really like them. havent actually used them for cross training as per their original design but i am planning too. thank you amazon and puma!!
B008AXY38Y Perfect fit I was hesitant to purchase shoes online, because often shoes run large or small, or could have insoles that are too high, or for a myriad of other possible issues. Anyway, I am glad that I did not give in to my hesitations, because these shoes worked perfectly for what he was looking for. They are sturdy for use, but lightweight for function. I think they look really nice on him, and he says that they fit great. I got a black puma tank so he could &#34;match&#34; and the outfit is adorable (in my opinion). Anyone looking to appear put together and serious about their workouts could benefit from these shoes.
B008AXY38Y Surin - nice looks but maybe not high performance...athletic imposter I bought these shoes for work, not athletics, because i like the Puma styling and i needed something &#34;clean&#34; to wear at work.  (It is impossible to find a plain white running shoe!)  Despite some recommendations to buy a 1/2 size up, i bought my regular size and it fits perfectly.  Not sure if this is due to my narrow foot, which seems to work well with Puma's narrow styling.  The shoe is comfortable to wear but i wouldn't choose this for athletics.  The materials are a little stiff and plastic-like and tend to squeak.  Other than that, the shoe meets my needs.
B008AXY38Y Fit Perfectly Perfect fit from the beginning with no tightness to complain about whatsoever. My feet are extreme happy and they told me to say, &#34;Thank You.&#34;
B008AXY38Y The best thing about this shoes is they look great! This shoes are great looking, but pretty average as far as comfort while exercising. And they are terrible as running shoes. But I can not fault them for that. If you are looking for a real serious shoe for &#34;cross-training&#34;, this is not it.
B008B0MGQ2 Great Puma shoe! I've always loved Puma's styling but their selection in the past was limited.  As a result, I've always run in Mizunos and Asics.  I needed to get a primarily white pair of running shoes for work but found it impossible to find anything in my usual brands.  I decided to search Puma and was pleasantly surprised to see how many &#34;white&#34; offerings they have.  The shoe's styling is great, looks good for work.  The shoes are extremely comfortable and while i wondered about the relatively low front foot, the padding is great and I wouldn't mind running in them if I wasn't trying to keep them clean for work.  (Not sure how they would hold up for high-mileage runners.)  Before buying, the reviews indicated that I should buy a size, which I did.  They fit fine but I think I will only go a half-size up when I order my next pair of Pumas.  Highly recommended.
B008BXRZ9W Wonderful little shoe! I purchased these for my five year old.  She is very picky about clothes, shoes, etc.  If there is anything slightly uncomfortable or &#34;off&#34; she notices (OCD?).  She loves these shoes and wears them with everything.  I was very pleased when I first saw them because they look much nicer than I expected.  They are sporty enough to wear at the park yet dressy enough to wear for fancier occasions.  Also, they seem to hold up well.  We are very pleased with these wonderful little shoes!
B008BXRZ9W Fits more like a ballerina flat or mary jane I bought these for my daughter to wear to school where the uniform requires &#34;athletic shoes&#34; and was hoping these would be a cute alternative to traditional sneakers. Normally I order my daughter a size 12 so that she has room to grow into it and because sneakers can afford to be a little roomy. In flats she wears a size 11  or 11.5. The size 12 sneaker does not stay on my daughter's foot because the elastic holding the shoe on her foot is not particularly tight- it is obviously not adjustable like laces would be. Because of this, I believe these probably aren't the best type of shoes for real athletic activities. If you order these, I suggest you pick the size that is your child's &#34;true size&#34;, not sneaker/boot size. Otherwise the shoe is very cute and the quality is on par with other Puma products.
B008EYP1K8 I love Puma Ballerina Shoes!!;-D I love the Puma Ballerina Slipper Shoes!! I own several pairs. They run about a half size small, but if you take that into consideration they fit wonderfully & look beautifully feminine.Sincerely,Mrs. &#34;I&#34;
B008EYP1K8 So comfortable! These Pumas are a great &#34;teacher&#34; shoe.  I am on my feet all day, and these are comfortable day in and day out.
B008F063BM Hard to find this style in stores I'm really glad that Amazon carries the full leather Pumas - these are the shoes I've been wearing for the past few years, and my workplace requires that you wear closed toe, decently waterproof shoes.  Most of the styles in my local stores (yes, even the local Puma store!) have mesh uppers.  If you have worn Pumas before, check your usual size and go with that, that's what I did.  If you are not sure what size to get, try to go to a store that sells them and try on a few.  Your size in Puma may be different than other brands because they do run a bit narrow.  If you have to get &#34;wide&#34; styles this shoe will not fit you.  I had to wear mine for a few days and break them in but they are very comfortable now.  I also tried on the silver/purple color but I didn't like it too much in person, and the returns were really easy with Amazon. This also makes it easy to try on multiple sizes.
B008F17R2K Just ok The shoes are very comfortable and nice looking. However, the &#34;spider webs&#34; on the outer part of the of the training shoes started to crack and eventually came apart after 2-3 months of moderate usage.
B008F17R2K I tried but this is one of the narrowest shoes I've owned.  I was hoping they would &#34;relax&#34; after a couple wearings, no luck.  I had to shelve these.
B008F17R2K LOVE THESE SHOES Hi All,Just to give you a quick review on this product.I have back and knee injury, and its very important for me to choose the right shoes....&#34;it rhymes hehe&#34; anyways, no matter how much I explain on how comfortable they are and the feeling that you're not walking on solid ground, yet perfect traction and stability to the feet and ankle. Also the colours, are fantastic, price perfect. I bought another two pairs with different colours.
B008F17R2K Well rounded Running shoe Bought these a few months ago.  First time I ever bought a sneaker without trying it on for fit.  Some reviews said runs a little small so I went from a 9 1/2 to ten.  Fit perfectly.  Very good sneaker.  Feels light, great for shorter runs and work-outs at the gym.  They look really cool too.  Got a few &#34; Hey where did you get those sneakers&#34;.  I can't comment on longevity yet.  So far for my workouts they are perfect.
B008F17R2K Not really happy only wore them on 4 times, on the fourth time after running a 2 mile run, i thought i had a rock stuck in the bottom, but it was actually a part of the &#34;bio web&#34; witch is plastic, is now broken, Its on the inside edge of the shoe.
B008F17R2K Shoes Now my #1 workout/running shoe. Love these shoes. People act like fry just say &#34;shut up and take my money.
B008F2AMQ2 Sporty and Comfortable I am a 70 year old woman who has lost almost 30 pounds through a weight loss program.  I can now wear cute athletic clothes.  This top is great over any tank top, including the one that comes with it.  Since my arms are not &#34;toned&#34;, it covers up the problem.  However, I probably should have ordered a small, instead of a medium, as the top part is definitely a drapy fit. It's a great look, anyway you crack it!
B008J0KM3I Love Puma I was sad to have to return this shirt, is was so nice looking. But a bit too short for my husband. He is 6'1&#34;, the shirt shrinks up a little bit in length when washed & cool dryed. Just too short.
B008J0VC0A Cute, comfy and sporty. Just as displayed, I didnt notice it was &#34;mesh&#34;when I ordered.  However the fabric was nice and the mesh was more of a texture then wholes it worked out just fine.  Comfy and cute. Great for layering
B008L74P0A Like the look I like the look of this sneaker and they fit well too. I do have wide feet and had to go with a larger size (I got the size 13, but I wear a 12 if they have a wide width) to have the shoes be comfortable.Given the latest style of sneakers is to be very colorful, it was nice to find a &#34;plain&#34; sneaker to wear.
B008QXBTF8 nice shooes but they squeek with each step the shoe fits true to size. is very nice in appearance but the upper materials (looks like [patent leather) cause them to creak or squeek with each step which is why i only gave them 3 stars (as &#34;ok&#34;). i thought they would break in and it would go away, but after 4 rounds of golf, they are still the same. i like the shoes but probably wouldn't buy another pair of them in the future because of that.
B008QY0MWS Excellent. I wore them today to play golf.  They fit great. This is my first pair of &#34;spike less&#34; golf shoes.  They are very comfortable and I enjoyed the day.  I think they will hold up well and give me years of enjoyment.
B008QY0MWS Puma spikeless golf shoe My normal shoe size is 9 1/2 D.  The length was fine but the width seems a little narrower than a &#34;D&#34; width.  I'm hoping they will widen with some wear.  Good looking shoe.
B008QY1N9O I really like the looks of all the Puma golf shoes I really like the looks of all the Puma golf shoes,but,what good are they if they don't fit well. Puma needs to offer their shoes in a &#34;wide&#34; size.American men have wide feet,why not make all shoe sizes available to fit.You'd sell more shoes,and have more satisfied customers!!!
B008QY1X0S Shoe uppers not as advertised When I ordered the PUMA AMP golf shoes I understood they had leather uppers as promoted on the website. However, when they arrived a sticker on the insole indicated they were instead manufactured of a synthetic material. Amazon immediately replaced them but, with the same shoe.On receipt of the second pair of the same shoes I called a customer service representative for Amazon who immediately contacted a customer service representative for PUMA. As I submit this review I'm still waiting to hear back from PUMA. However, that representative did state that the material may be a &#34;synthetic leather&#34;, rather than the traditional animal skin leather, but they(the representative) would advise me further once they had some feedback.It just seemed a little odd that if the shoes were manufactured with a &#34;synthetic leather&#34; material rather than real leather that PUMA didn't promote them as such. Appears that PUMA may not have provided all the appropriate informatiion about these golf shoes when they made them available for sale with Amazon.
B008RAGKBS Very comfortable As a &#34;Puma&#34; fan I was quick to grab these for the low price offered. After running in them all my aches and pains were gone, love the shoes.
B008UR908S great service the shirt came looking exactly as it is advertised, the size was correct (LX) im 6 foot 1 about 225lbs with an athletic/ a little to lose build and the shirt fit very well. It arived on the earliest projected delivery date (which is always great). Shirt quality (fabric) is a 10 out of 10... what the pictures dont show (maybe they do and i missed it) is there is a small grey &#34;puma&#34; emblem on the side of the left sleve, which i thought was a nice touch.
B008USM89A Very Cute My daughter loves &#34;comfy clothes&#34;. She is about to turn 7. We bought a 6x... Fits snug. She will be able to wear it for a couple months. Should have bought a 7. It looks adorable on her:-)
B008VQPB4A Comfortable and... ...very light and sturdy.  We used this in a professional production, and the dancer said it was one of the most comfortable and well-supported &#34;non-dance&#34; footwear they'd worn.  It gave great traction without impeding fast turns, and gave excellent support to the feet.
B008VUG4FG Kicking it old school This is the second pair of PUMAs my son has requested.  His first was for last year, and when he was asked what sneakers does he want for this school year, he said &#34;PUMA sneakers, again&#34;.  He says they are super comfortable.  The only down-side is that the laces don't stay tied unless you double knot them.  We figured out a way to tie that kept them tied all day and shortly after that it no longer became an issue.
B00903XD6Q Great shoe Very comfortable, fits just like the other shoes in the &#34;El Ace&#34; line. It is very comfortable, much moreso than other puma shoes I've had. Overall extremely happy
B0098IBSTM Puma has long history wore first Puma shoes shipped to US playing football at U of Alabama in 1964...they were awesome then and these shoes continue that tradition...especially like their contour to my feet and durability (wore last pair 7 yrs)...these shoes spell &#34;athlete&#34;...
B0098ID10G Nice Light Shoes. We purchased these shoes for my 13 year old son that has feet that are growing quickly.  He really likes them.  His exact words are &#34; They are light weight, furry on the inside, and cool.&#34;  These are definitely worth your money.
B009FDO3U6 MMMhmmm I'd prefer them to be &#34;slightly wider&#34;, very comfy for the price. I have 2 pairs. 1 for work (in a warehouse at that, 2 months and they're still going strong) and another for the gym.
B009FDPVRK If the shoe doesn't fit, no free Prime purchase return Despite ordering a half-size larger than my actual shoe size (based on reviews warning that the shoe fits &#34;too snug&#34;), the shoe is fitting too tight - and despite purchased with Amazon Prime, the seller - ShoeMall - is not paying for return shipping on the basis that the shoe is &#34;not materially different from advertised&#34; even though you must order the shoe a whole size larger than what your feet actually measure! This is false advertising - and although I purchased the shoe for $26, the same size and color shoe - even the next half-size bigger identical color scheme available of this model - both now costs $33 two days after I received the shoe! What  a scam!
B009FM4BCW As I remembered Shoe fit as expected and was like the photo.  Liked the &#34;half box&#34; packaging and re-usable bag. Very comfortable casual shoe
B009FMQXLE Great! I bought these on sale for about $20 and have been wearing them almost daily for about 5 months by now.  They hold up pretty well, and are easy to keep clean and looking nice.  The shoe is made from some kind of synthetic material that resembles a snow jacket I own; very smooth and very tolerant of water.  They fit a bit smaller than I expected, but after a week they loosened up and fit better.In my opinion, the rubber sole is the worst part about the shoe.  I don't know if it's the pattern on the bottom or just the rubber material, but it makes a &#34;sticking&#34; sound when walking on hard surfaces.  I've checked many times that there isn't any residue/gunk on the sole.  I've also noticed a few times that I don't have great traction on wet streets and sidewalks.  I haven't fallen or anything, but I have noticed my foot slide forward an inch or so a few times.Overall, I think I got an amazing deal on a quality shoe.  I almost wish I bought an extra set for when these eventually wear out.
B009FMSK1A Cheap They don't make them like they use too. The shoes were so small, almost to the point were my feet looked abormally tiny. They really weren't that comfortable, and for the price you can pickup a pair of pro vans that are as equally sporty and wear-in much nicer. The aesthetics are really the only reason to purchase the shoe, but even that in person appears cheaply stitched and only lightly durable.The &#34;lite&#34; is an excuse for skimping on quality. I'm returning this product asap.
B009FN614C Great Shoes! These shoes are absolutely perfect! I grabbed them at a great price and they were shipped immediately! I bought them because they're different. Amazon has a superb selection of things that are &#34;different&#34; and that's why I will always be a customer. Thanks Amazon, for having a huge selection of &#34;different&#34; items.
B009FN614C Comfortable and easy to walk in I got these for work for a more punk look but something that wouldn't totally kill my feet. They are super comfortable for the near 3&#34; heel that is concealed. Unlike most other wedge sneakers the heel is not super thin so it looks less conspicuous and more realistic.  I've gotten many complements on them with my shorter friends thinking that I had finally reached the 6' mark.  Not horrible for running out to my car during a downpour but I was really paranoid about falling or turning over my ankle. Some guys tend to think that they are weird because &#34;sneakers are for exercise&#34; but whatever Chucks suck for running too, fashionable sneakers exist.All in all good value for the price.
B009FN614C Nice shoe...nice price! I am happy with my shoes.  They are super cute.  I receive tons of compliments...and the hubby loves them.  He says they make me look like a &#34;sporty shorty&#34;.  LOL!  I would definately purchase another pair in another color.
B009FN614C Cool appearance These are &#34;good&#34; shoes.  Fit is true to size and comfortable but they are slightly clunky.  I also have the MY style and prefer the MY style more.
B009G1T5YG Puma Bioweb running shoe the color is SO bright...I have to get used to it. Fit is very tight but I'm hoping that as I use them they will stretch. I think I prefer a shoe with more &#34;air&#34;. the bioweb is  close on the foot....my tootsies get hot.
B009G1T5YG I want another pair!!!! These shoes are perfect for walking, running, and just cute to wear for a relaxing day!!! I don't think I want them to get dirty! Tried them on perfect fit, light, the rubber cushion adds support to my heels. Very comfortable. I didn't know I was purchasing the official &#34;cage&#34; material which makes the shoe even lighter! The colors are amazing&#8230;now I have to buy the puma pants to match! I will get another pair soon in another color. Thanks!
B009G1T5YG Bought new but got USED! I bought this because it was on sale. When it arrived I tried on my size 9's and they were too small so I sent them back and got a 1/2 size bigger. When the &#34;new&#34; pair arrived it wasn't &#34;new.&#34; They were not in the original box, the bag my other shoes came with was not included and the worst part was that the one shoe had a big black scratch on the back of the heal. I am not happy about getting used when I paid for new but I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning another pair because the company no longer had the size shoe I needed to trade my return with.As for the design of the shoe. The colors are bright and the shoes look neat but they are not very comfortable. You feel like you are going to fall backwards plus there are no arch supports.
B009G1U2XE love these shoes After searching for shoes for many days on many different sites looking for a good shoe that doesn't cost a small fortune I chose the Puma cross trainer.  I LOVE The purple [they call it Liberty Blue] and have gotten numerous compliments on how cute they are.  I do mainly Zumba classes and these shoes are really perfect for that--no too much &#34;tread&#34; so I don't mess up my knees when doing the dance moves.  Don't think these would be appropriate for heavy running on pavement or any hard hitting exercise like that but for my purposes these are ideal.
B009G1U2XE very cute, a bit too snug I gave these shoes 4 stars because they are well constructed and I liked the color (pink/white). They look just as pictured.The description says that they are cross-trainers but the inside of the shoe says &#34;running&#34;. Little confused about that but such is life.The fit of the shoe is too small and they are a little stiff right when you put them on. Also, the tongue has a hard tab that hits your shin if you are doing anything other than standing around in them.I got a 9 because I have another pair of Pumas in that size and they fit perfectly. That said, it is a different style but it shouldn't be that different.I planned on using these for P90X3 but they are a bit too snug for all the required jumping around. I would return for the 9.5 but they aren't available in that size. I would keep them just for bumming around in but I really need cross trainers that do what I want them to do. I'm selling them to a friend with smaller feet!Advice: order at least a half size up if you are using these for workouts.
B009G1UD2E Ugh!  ) : So very disappointed in the construction. the shoe was listed as &#34;perforated leather&#34; the entire shoe was synthetic. Would've been great had it been constructed from leather!
B009GZS6OW fine shoes I use these for day to day activities like biking, walking, running, office work, and exercising.  They fit well, and are sturdy.  I was hoping they would loosen up a bit, but have stayed fairly resilient (read durable).  They hide dirt well, mine still look nearly new, people will still comment on my &#34;new shoes&#34;, even though they are several months old.
B009GZS6OW Nice looking shoes, but poor fit. I loved how these shoes looked on me, but the biggest downfall was their fit. The heel of the shoe kept digging into my heel, causing great discomfort. I tried to keep wearing them in, but it eventually became unbearable for me to continue wearing them. I even got some &#34;heel protectors&#34; to add, but that didn't seem to help either.I'm confident in the size being correct, because I have about half a dozen other pair of PUMAs in this size and they all fit fine. The only reason this product gets 2 stars instead of 1, is because it is a slick looking shoe... but the discomfort of the heel ruined it for me.
B009KBNNVI A good shoe for the price The shoe is sturdy, but hard to put on my 6 year old which make mornings difficult, but he likes them because he thinks they're &#34;cool&#34;
B009KRMGFQ No discernable arch. I bought these because Puma (sadly) doesn't make a 5 in the corresponding ladies' shoe.  So, I bought the child's version.  They are truly adorable, and fit pretty well.  However (as it the fault of many children's shoes) there is no discernible arch support in this shoe!  It's both disappointing and devaluing.  Children (and small-footed-adults) deserve to have their feet and arches protected, too.I would say fit is pretty true, however, the size correspondence to adult sizes is not exact.  The 3 seems to be a teensie smidge smaller than I expected, but it still fits so the difference is negligible.  The back of the heel (particularly the decorative point in back) is a little high; they would be more comfortable without that).Fortunately, they don't &#34;look like children's shoes,&#34; which I love.  I also love that the fit discourages my under-pronation.  They are also super-light.They have silver stitching that's not really apparent in the photo.
B009KSDEYM My daughter call it her "cool shirt" My daughter loves this shirt and calls it her &#34;cool shirt&#34; because of the cut outs on the shoulders.  It's her favorite shirt and alway her first pick when deciding what she wants to wear.
B009KVEDCG Great "little kid ease" for "big kids" My 9 year old son was very excited about these shoes. His Dad has a pair and finds them very comfortable and flexible for everyday wear. I love the neoprene & that came in handy when my son fell in a small pond recently! It is hard to find velcro or easy slip on sneakers for &#34;big kids&#34; and these fit the bill perfectly. I was really happy with this purchase.
B009MNZO3O Puma Shoes -- Not enough Support Shoes were colorful and attractive; but &#34;b&#34; width is too wide for me.  The mesh material has too much &#34;give&#34;.
B009SD2936 Love my Puma El Reys! I had the Puma &#34;Barrel roll&#34; before, a similar slip-on style, love em, then puma stopped making them? So I tried the Puma El Rey and couldn't be happier. My shoe size is right between a 9.5 & 10. So any Puma size 10 always works for me. These are comfortable, easy to keep clean and i wear them everyday to work for last 6 months and still holding up very well!Gonna order me another pair (color)!
B009SUAWDI My all-time favorite Puma shoe! I love that this shoe feel &#34;solid,&#34; meaning that there is no cloth material, it's sturdy, and it feels like the shoes are giving my feel a nice big hug.  They are very supportive and I just love them.  Took me a long time to find the exact shoe I liked, but once I found them, I bought them in two different colors!!
B009XP4FXQ Nice look and breathable These are my everyday shoes.They have a great and simple design. The seamed stitching makes the transitions pop.The lining of the shoe is made of a mesh so its very breathable. Keeps my feet cool and dry. &#34;Would be ideal if you have sweaty or warm feet.&#34;The soles of the shoe have a nice grip from the rubber. So i am not sliding all over the sealed concrete floors at work.
B009YTPK8A Nice shoes Very bright and are unique on the field. Not another one of those &#34;twinkie&#34; shoes. Excellent construction and bright colors.
B00A0HE6PS Great Turf Shoe and Price! I purchased these for my 10 year old son for indoor soccer.  They are very versatile.  He can wear them on many surfaces: padded floor, tiled floor, regular turf and the new &#34;like grass&#34; turf.  The knobs are also deep enough wear they can grip outdoor grass as well.They are true to size and fit as expected.  First time wear was comfortable, and did not cause blisters.  They also appear well made, with sturdy stitching and formed tongue.  The coloring is attractive as well, and the price was great!
B00AAIP7MI Yup, I'm an adult who wore it Got this skirt for mixing up kayaking and hiking to still also be ale to go to lunch and look sort of &#34;put together&#34; after. I got a large, and as a 5'5&#34; 120lb adult, it was still a little short and snug (though mid-thigh is short to me). Very bright and cute, the PUMA logo on it is indeed HUGE with acid yellow thread!I really do love this little skort, my only complaint would be that while the skort itself is a great heavy nylon/lycra/spandex, the shorts underneath are a thin and slightly translucent cotton that ride up a little, undies still required. Overall could really be great for kids or adult. I'd order again.
B00AB2N2DO Well made, stylish, and won't break the bank Lightweight, nice matte finish, fits well, and no distortion. My previous favorite pair of polarized sunglasses were also Pumas which outlasted two pairs of higher-end &#34;designer&#34; sunglasses, taking a severe beating before I finally lost them after 4 years. I'm hoping these will hold up just as well.
B00AFPN4NA Big Puma fan As a huge fan of the Puma brand, I had to buy this for my little girl when I saw the steal of a price!  I know that the Puma tends to run smaller in clothing, so as she was fitting in 9 months, I knew a she could start wearing this jogging suit in 12 months.  The pants seemed to run a little long in the leg, but other than that the fit was perfect.  She is absolutely adorable in this outfit (as she is in everything she wears, of course) and she has received MANY compliments when she wears her first Puma track suit.  We are sure to buy more, especially if deals keep coming around like we &#34;stole&#34; on this outfit!!
B00AKQHCHI HOTT I bought this shirt for my husband who enjoyes tanks/sleeveless shirts for his workouts. It looks great on him, and fit exactly how we were expecting. The color is nice and rich black, which is really flattering. Some &#34;black&#34; shirts are more grey or green-tone, but this is true black. The quality is very nice, and you can tell that it was sewn with care - no loose strings or uneven edges. I will be repurchasing in a different color sometime in the near future.
B00AKQHJ5I Very comfortable Very comfortable to wear around the house, etc. on hot summer days.  They feel softer and are less &#34;clingy&#34; than all-polyester.
B00AKSPJVM Loved it but had to return it Very nice fabric, but it is a bit short in length. I bought XLarge for my 6'1&#34; husband, it iswas approx 1 1/2&#34; shorter compared to lets say Gildan 50/50% cotton. With this shirt being 100% cotton, you know it would shrink a bit more. It was a very nice shirt, but didn't want to chance any shrinkage.
B00AKSRDE8 fitted shirt... should have realized it is a bit narrow (fitted), was thinking it would be a normal polo, but the large &#34;DUCATI&#34; on the back is a little overkill.  nice quality though.
B00AKSY3RS Good Quality Sweatpants Only con for me is that they are a little too long. I'm 6'2&#34;/180 Ibs and usually large is my size but in this case it seems they may be running a little long, but the waist is right though.
B00AKUCU7G The Unexpected! This jacket is not true to size; it runs a bit big.  That really was not that much of a concern for me even though I'm slim to average build.  What bothered me more was the fabric itself.  The material feels like a &#34;synthetic&#34;.  It doesn't feel comfortable and the bottom is just drops.  It is not what I expected.  I don't recommend this jacket.Dr. D
B00AOAQAJG Too hard! I was not satisfied with these Puma's...I did return them...I found them too hard in the inside for a sneaker and a bit too narrow. A very nice rich color in spite of the discomfort. &#34;LOL&#34;
B00AOAQAJG Crazy about this show. Crazy about this shoe.  Never had a &#34;sneaker&#34; that felt this comfortable.  So good looking too.  Color selection is terrific.  You've delivered an unexpected experience....PERFECTION.
B00AOAQAJG Fit true to size, stylish, and lift me up a bit I ordered my normal size 7.5 in white swan-curbs & whey (they are light beige) with pale gold side stripe, pretty much like the online photos.  They are a bit snug but will stretch a bit after wearing. The heel is 1.5&#34; which is perfect and lift me up a bit (I am 5'6&#34;), not too exaggerated like those sneakers with 3&#34; hidden heel.  They are comfortable and stylish.  Very satisfied with this purchase.
B00AOAQAJG Good for achilles tendon problems I was looking for an &#34;athletic&#34; shoe with a heel high enough to relieve achilles tendonitis pain but not too high to actually use for walking/working/mild exercise. These fit the bill pretty well. While not as comfortable as a real tennis shoe, they do have a wide enough base for stability and some tread. I agree that these are not super comfy when you first put them on; a little stiff and narrow, but they DO soften up and widen out a bit pretty quickly. I added a set of gel heel pads and found them comfortable enough to buy a second pair (and my 13 yo wants some now, too!) Normally an 8, bought the 8.5 and they fit well.
B00AOCAP9A super comfortable & well worth the money! I love these cross-trainers! As others have said in their reviews so are so light it's as if there's nothing in the pkg when it arrives! The arch support in these are fabulous and don't bother my feet what so ever! Although they do fit somewhat small they are not to tight on me (depending on the socks I wear...if I wear thicker sox they're not too tight but less comfortable than with thinner sox). Also, as other's have noted, the back does come up high so I do wear &#34;higher&#34; sox instead of the low foot sox. I absolutely love these Pumas though and will be purchasing another pair I'm sure!
B00AOCAP9A Very light and very comfy My shoes are perfect. Since I have a condition that causes my feet to swell quite a bit on occasion, I need shoes that can accommodate both the &#34;normal&#34; feet and the swollen feet. I've worn these in both conditions and they are so adjustable that they were comfy either way. I heartily recommend these.
B00AOCE7IA Well pleased These shoes are amazingly comfortable! They are lightweight, easy to clean, and built for &#34;movability.&#34; I work at Home Depot and walk around on cement floors for hours and hours at a time and the insoles provided in the shoes are the perfect cushiony pillow to ease the pain of cement walking. Highly recommend! : )
B00AOCE7IA the coolest shoes ever!!! This is a perfect shoe for people who don't like a thick sole. I have the soliel also, but I love these. My brother in law said the colors were &#34;classy for a tennis shoe&#34;. My neighbor said they were &#34;sexy&#34;, she wants me see if I can order her some... I might just keep my secret.
B00AODTEZA Lots of compliments People always say &#34;cool shoes dude&#34; (some leave off the &#34;dude&#34;).  I picked the white/brilliant blue color.  Puma gear is very stylish and all the rage again, so I would recommend after wearing 10 times or so.If you are looking for a great running shoe, I'd say this isn't it.  If you are in to running, you need to check out Altra--the best shoe around in my opinion.  Altra shoes and their online running style / coaching are the best thing that has happened to me.If you are looking for a great looking shoe with a pretty good build to use at the gym or tooling around, I do like these Pumas.As for size, I ordered my normal 11's which nearly always work for me, and these feel a touch tight and small.  They seemed closer to 10 1/2's maybe.  If you're in between, move up the half size.
B00AODVKJI My son LOVES them My son, who is growing like a weed, loves running shoes. So much so that he won't wear anything else unless he absolutely has to, so I always want to get his very, very good ones. His favorite brand is Puma, and his favorite color is blue. Match made in heaven, and the price was exceptional. He says they fit perfectly, are very lightweight, very comfortable, and &#34;feel fast.&#34; I love the cool webbing design overlay. Given that he just finished an advertising unit in his English class, I am sure all his friends are feeling the &#34;bandwagon&#34; effect today because it's his first day wearing them to school. Great shoes. We even ordered a pair in the next size up so that when he outgrows these, he will have another pair ready to go.
B00AODVKJI Not Comfortable I don't believe anyone over 170lb.s would be able to wear these shoes in comfort.The side of the &#34;bioweb&#34; is hard while the middle is flexible causing the foot to become pinched between the hard sides of the shoe.It was immediately uncomfortable. Particularly on the heel.This poorly designed shoe doesn't live up to the former pumagility line.
B00AODW9HA My son has big feet My son is only 10 he wears a men's size 8. I need to find a shoe that is still kid friendly. He loves his new shoes! He thinks he can jump and run faster, because of the &#34;puma&#34;. His favorite color is blue and it goes great with his colombia blue sweater.
B00AOE059S Looks better on the pictures than in person. As others have mentioned, these are very tight, so err on the side of picking a larger size.  I wear an 11.5 to 12 and I bought the 12's and I can barely get my feet in these.  They are ok once they are on, they are still snug but very lightweight and airy.Aesthetically speaking, they are pretty tough.  In the pictures they look kinda wild but still wearable for casual use. In person, those black and white horizontal &#34;laces&#34; (no laces) on the top make them look like clown shoes or something a Super-villian would wear in a Batman comic.If you can stand the way they look, more power to you.  Get a half-size bigger than normal.  For me, these became my work around the house shoes.
B00AOE059S Perfect i Love them, they fit me like a &#34;shoe&#34;.They are better than expected.i Bought them to exercise now i work in them, dont wanna take them off!!!
B00AOMYC2Q Different "D" then I've ever worn. I read the reviews before I bought these, with many suggesting...getting a 1/2 size length bigger. which I did, but  still too thin. The width description says size &#34;D&#34;, but Puma must have a different size &#34;D&#34; width, than any D I've ever worn. I put them sole to sole with my Nike's which are &#34;D&#34;s as well and the Puma's were about 1/4 inch thinner on each side. I returned them and will try another red Puma, going up to 11.5 and hopefully they will fit.
B00AOMYC2Q This is what makes PUMA great! I must say the show caught my eye with its flashiness, but it also brought back some big time nostalgia for me.  You see, I wore a similar bright yellow and Black trimmed shoe in high school on the track team.  Those shoes were called by many the &#34;Puma Banana&#34;,  oh I loved those shoes, not only did I wear them for the running part of practice and Track meets, but I also wore them when I threw the Shot Put!  I considered them my lucky shoes!  So for that reason, if for no other , I was very excited to see them in the Eastbay Catalog.  Now all that being said, these are not &#34;track shoes&#34; & their maker does not even list them as being for Jogging, but they are, I believe... A soccer training shoe for use on inside turf.  For me they are shoes I wear to work out, which now most consists of weight training and stationary biking, and things of that ilk.  The shoes are FANTASTIC, they do every thing asked of them, they are comfortable and are exactly the size I bought.  Plus they look AWESOME!!  If you are at all interested I would definitely recommend them, because they are extraordinary shoes, made by an extraordinary company, try it you'll like 'em!
B00AOMZH1Q Future Cat Very light weight and extremely narrow around the mid sole and toes. I had purchased a size larger for accommodate for the narrow fit, nevertheless, theses cats are constructed &#34;Narrowly&#34;. Vivid bright color assortment. Feels cheap.
B00AONVA52 Frankly darling its how you look - and you look marvelous very stylish, but as everyone else reports, and I will as well, THEY RUN SMALL and NARROW!  I am an 11 or 11.5 but after reading the reviews I ordered the 12s AND wholly...  they are a bit tight and def way narrow - not so much that i need to return them but def tight. Im hoping the nice faux leather, which is very, with break in and get a better feel. As style goes these shoes with a pair of jeans or khakis, dark T or short sleeve button down and you're stylin' ready for a stroll on the boardwalk or casual night out.*Note: not for all day on your feet walking, the sole and construction of this shoe will not provide all day support for your feet, little to no arch support. if you're prone to suburnation or pronation Do not buy these you will twist your ankle on the first uneven ground step. Otherwise they look sweet!3 Stars is because they are more &#34;Form&#34; than &#34;Function&#34;(5 stars are products that excel in looks (form) and usability/operation (function) and value to price ratio ( 1 to 1)
B00AONVA52 Sturdy, Light, No-Nonsense These shoes are exactly what I've wanted my whole life. Slip-on, minimalist feel with great tread and comfortable &#34;dress-shoe&#34; presence. Might only buy Pumas from now on.
B00AONW9JS Beware of sizes I rated this &#34;fit as expected&#34; because this is my 4th pair of these shoes.  Off of standard sizes they do fit a bit snug.  Always best to error on the side of caution and go a half size larger from what you usually wear.
B00AONWIC6 Great look, narrow fit I normally wear an 11. These run at least and I have narrow-ish feet. All the &#34;drift&#34; styles I've tried are that way. Great look if they fit. Lots of complements.
B00AONWIC6 Not confortable, too tight and small. Too hot They are not nearly as comfortable as my last five pairs for &#34;PUMA GRIT CAT III P&#34; which are now out of production.Usually I wear 9.5 puma shoes, with this model I think I have to go with 10 but they also are too loose.They are hot as hell!I am gonna miss the so great PUMA GRIT CAT III P
B00AONWIC6 My Older One's Are Better Quality I've had Drift Cat's in the past and I liked them - even though I always have to order a larger size. This model was no exception... a half size smaller than most brands.But the sizing isn't why I returned them. The side &#34;swish&#34; looks like very cheap material and the stitching, well, let's say I can't image these holding together, particularly since they fit snug.$70 shoe? No and while I only paid $35, I didn't think they were worth that either. :(
B00AONWP6U Puma is a half size smaller than other brands, ... Puma is a half size smaller than other brands, but knowing that I order 11,5 and fit perfectly for me. Are fresh and light, and look wonderfull.A lot of people tell me, &#34;it are beautifull&#34;.
B00AOOH730 Great shoe and packaging. I used to wear my old boyfriend's pumas. Came across a picture of me and realized I loved the shoes. Sad when you think I wore the same size as my boyfriend. He was tiny or I'm a genetic freakshow. But more comforting than him puking in my bedroom. (He called it a &#34;present&#34;)
B00AOOH730 Very confortable ;) It's also beautiful and confortable. I was looking for a &#34;low profile&#34; and all black/all gray sneacker and it fits perfect on my needs. It's also very well engineered with good care on details. Very good materials and beatiful. Very nice shoes!
B00AOOL1SC OLD SCHOOL REVIEW!!! I am what's known as &#34;grown & sexy&#34;! I harken back to a kool & funky time known as the &#34;the 70's&#34;! These sneakers bring me back to that much simpler time! They're very comfortable & easy to wear. I absolutely love 'em!
B00AOOYT22 Looks Great, came with a scratch The shoe looks great, feels comfy and since I'm super flat footed I got the &#34;S&#34; for extra support. It feels exactly as advertised. My feet are snug and supported. My only feedback is that this one had a scratch on the front reflector part. I'm too lazy to return it just for that especially since I'll be wearing these shoes to the ground but I felt I needed to give that feedback because brand new should feel brand new.
B00AQ1HX1C Great workout shirt I'm only 5'5&#34; and a medium is perfect for me, this might be a little small for someone who is of average height.
B00AQODE9E comfortable + ugly = fail Though these socks are comfortable, I think I will have to return them because of how horribly they look on the feet.  I'm not looking for a white sock to be a fashion statement, but these are just plain over the top.  I'd rate it &#34;comfortable, but ugly&#34;.  Really on the fence of giving it 1 or 2 stars.  Tempted to give it 2 stars because they do fit well.  But if the total picture makes them worthless, I don't really see it being worth more than a 1.
B00ASRGZEK Great socks! My son loves his new socks.  He says they are &#34;cushy&#34; and very comfortable. He also likes the style of the coloring.
B00AWXMN6O Good quality and price! I worry about the quality of cotton because sometime it was marked &#34;cotton&#34; but end up not 100% cotton or fine cotton. This one was made of fine cotton and felt very comfortable. Besides that, the price is so good too.
B00AWY5TQ4 puma pants The ordered was a medium size,but the inseam length more than 34&#34;now i have to fold the bottom. the garment you wear should be perfectly fit.
B00AWY5TQ4 Puma pant The pant did not fit the way I wanted.my waist is 32inches,and this more than 34.the length also was not  to my inseam length.it is 34 inches where my inseam measurement is 32 in he's.Arif SIDDIQUI
B00AWYTLQS Nice but short. I am 5'8&#34; and these were too short.  I continue to look for track pants that are flattering, comfy, and long enough when you buy a small.
B00AY65V1I adequate shoe Not the greatest show ive ever owned.  They fit smaller than I would expect which made them uncomfortable during crossfit.  They aren't great running shoes (for me) but they were excellent for box jumps and lifting because they aren't &#34;cushiony&#34;.
B00AYBQL4Y Cute This outfit is very cute .... my daughter calls them &#34;girl power&#34; outfits... it is all she wants to wear. They do run a little small so may want to order a bigger than usual size.  Since they are leggings the length is not a problem. Great price.
B00B4S5TRG These shoes look amazing in person! The pink color is very vibrant; my gf loves them! It is hard to tell in the pic but the shiny black &#34;scale&#34; looking things really look good in the sunlight. They lightly sparkle but not so much that they look cheesy. From the picture I thought they were sequins but they are not; they lay flat on the fabric of the shoe. The quality is a bit less than expected from Puma, but these aren't meant for performance, so they really do earn a 5 star rating just for how cute they are.
B00B5013PK Cool Cleat! I purchased these as a gift for my 6 year old niece. This is her first season playing soccer and she immediately liked the &#34;cool&#34; look of the cleats. After a couple of practices/games she says they are very comfortable. She normally wears a size 13.5, but her mom suggested buying a half size up to a 1, because the soccer socks are made of a thicker material - Mom was right!
B00B50348E Puma every time My 7-year old 'Real Madrid' fan loves these shoes. They have nice rubber cleats with good traction.Fit is for narrower feet, and I wrote &#34;fit as expected&#34; because from experience I know that Pumas tend torun about 1/2-size small.
B00B5HUIO0 Really cute shoes, but size up! I loved the way these looked, but as my son wears about 9.5 in length in most shoes, I ordered an 11.5. My son has unusually fat feet and a lot of shoes just don't fit, which is why I like velcro. When we got these, I saw the velcro doesn't extend all the way across the strap (weird), there is an inch or two of &#34;blank space&#34;. So we had to put these on him without socks and really pull just to get the velcro to attach. There was a big open velcro gap space showing where we couldn't pull them tight enough. After a couple wearings they are starting stretch and look better, but I doubt he could ever wear socks them.So I give four stars for cuteness, but am taking one off for lack of good design. Widen the foot and extend the velcro, and it could be five stars.
B00B5HUIO0 Good fit for my 3 year old boy! My son loves his &#34;fast shoes&#34;. He is 3 and he can get these shoes on and off by himself now. Suede is tougher to keep looking new, but he still likes them.
B00B7LUG00 So cushy, very comfortable! Really enjoying these shoes, very comfortable and &#34;cushy&#34; all around my feet.  They feel almost like moon shoes if that makes any sense.  Snug fit overall, very nice to jog in, gave these Pumas a try for about $55 and don't regret it one bit.  No complaints, they fit my big feet just right.
B00B7LUG00 the look I chose these for their &#34;look&#34; and was not disappointed. Their length seems perfect but the width may be a hair too wide for my feet.  Not a big enough problem to stop me form wearing and enjoying them.
B00B7LUG00 Nice shoe Shoe fits exactly as it should.  Light weight and they look good.  I was a little dissapointed with the &#34;plastic&#34; looking tongue, but other than that the shoe is very nice and feels great on my feet.
B00B7LUG00 soft, pliable and very comfortable I am large (240 pounds) with big feet.  Very few shoes are completely comfortable with no &#34;break in&#34; period.  I have worn these up to 16 hours with no discomfort.  They may well be the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn.
B00B7LUYFC Great additon to my workout shoe collection! Super comfortable, stylish workout shoe.  I go to the gym daily and like to rotate shoes.  Somewhat apprehensive to order a shoe &#34;on-line&#34; but the &#34;fit&#34; and &#34;reviews&#34; helped, glad I did order.  The pricing was very competitive too.  I had Puma football shoes in college (long ago...) and liked them, glad to see PUMA still making a quality product.
B00B7LUYFC Well constructed shoe. I use this shoe primarily for low impact aerobic exercising.  I also wear for a &#34;geezer&#34; league volleyball play..  The performance is good and they are a very comfortable shoe.
B00BAO96O6 Fantastic watch! I love this watch: very easy to wear, to set-up, and to read. The only problem is that the analog function is &#34;fuel.&#34; This is a term I was unfamiliar with prior to purchasing this watch. I other words, the analog function is &#34;self-winding.&#34; If you rotate it with other watches like I do, then it will stop and needs to be reset. I found an easy solution, recommended by other reviewers, and bought an automatic winder which works perfectly. Even with the fuel/anaolg situation, this still an outstanding watch. LOVE it.
B00BAXWTT6 Happy kid... Junior loves these.  The soles are a bit sturdier than some of the Pumas we've had but still not full on &#34;tennis shoe&#34; thick.  They're great for elementary school, recess, and general mayhem.  The two hook-and-latch closures are surviving being cranked down as hard as the kid can manage much better than one-closure versions have done.
B00BBATXSS Super Cute Cutest short set ever, so precious on my grand daughter, she is cute as a button in this.  And she loves it, starting kindergarten and she said &#34;Don't I look just so special&#34;  Ha, I think so and the shopping on Amazon makes my life so smooth with delivery to the front door, Amazon rules!!!!!!!
B00BBXN0RK Cute for Kids This fit just as expected. Maybe a little snug, but that's seems to be the same for any &#34;workout&#34; style clothing.
B00BEIOZAI A bit large this time I've ordered this shoe many times over the years (and always loved them!) and while it always fit &#34;true to size&#34; this particular pair seemed to fit about 1/2 size larger.
B00BOZAW6W HEAD TURNERS NICE SHOES, PRETTY COLORS! I RECEIVED ALOT OF COMMENTS , LOOKS AND QUESTIONS LIKE &#34; WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE SHOES?&#34;
B00C5TN7G8 Fit smaller feet fine I wear an 8.5 slip on and a 9 lace up shoes. I MUCH prefer the &#34;no show&#34; socks over these &#34;low cut&#34; socks (they are above the ankle), but I really like these. I ended up buying 3 versions of these: This pair, a white pair, and a black and dark gray. All have the same design, just vary in color. This pair here fits me perfectly! The black/dark gray ones AND the white ones are too big, and that's after several washings in hot water and high heat drying. If you're on the bigger end of the fit range, you might want to go with white or dark gray ones. Otherwise, these socks are amazingly comfortable. I've replaced all my socks with various Puma ones.
B00C6BOILS leather or  not I do not know what type of material  is &#34;other material&#34; but I do know that it is not leather .  I thought I would be getting leather but received a synthetic substance.  Maybe its my fault for not checking  the fine print.  Shoes of lesser value were made from the real stuff.
B00C6BUJDY LOVE THEM!!! These shoes are awesome. I'm always scared about buying shoes online because I never know how they will fit. I wear between a 9.5 and a 10 and I saw the reviews that said to buy big, so I bought the 10. They are SOOOOO comfortable. And they are quality! Other shoes that are similar that I have purchased have threads coming off shortly after purchase. I wear these all the time and they are amazing in quality! If I had more money I would buy the other options as well.Everywhere I go I get at least one person who says &#34;Awesome shoes&#34;. The first one was a waiter at Red Lobster. They are  more than I could have hoped for.
B00C6BUJDY Cute and comfy I am in my mid 30s and thought these would be to &#34;kiddy&#34; but they are very mature and sexy. I also have the white pair which I love alot!
B00C6EW87G Sizes run small, but still a good shoe I usually wear a 7 1/2 to an 8 when I get shoes.  The other reviews said to go a size up, so I did and bought an 8 1/2.  They fit perfectly!  I love these shoes, and have gotten tons of compliments on them.  I am a CNA and I bought them for work.  The first week I wore them, my feet were hurting by the end of the night.  Not really bad, just a little.  Now that I'm used to them, it's fine.  They do seem to be a little flimsy.  Not really &#34;running&#34; shoe, but it works. All in all, I really like these shoes.  They look great, and I didn't have to pay a ton of money to get them.
B00C6EW87G Love them These are minimalist shoes - almost like the Vibram 5 finger - and feels like you are going barefoot but have some sole & foot protection.There is little arch support so you can add an insert if needed and &#34;no-show&#34; pedi socks work well.  I read the previous reviews and ordered half size up and it was a perfect fit.  Liked them so much I ordered the blue & pink pairs.  Good bargain at $30 apiece.
B00C6EW87G They'll do I &#34;needed&#34; a casual athletic shoe and did not want a clunky sneaker.  I've been searching and searching for a replacement of my old Pumas that are so worn that they give me plantar fasciitis when I wear them (but they still look fantastic; so hard to part with them...).These are just fine.  They're not my old Pumas (alas), but they'll do.  They fit my flat, narrow foot very well.  I love the low profile and cushioned footbed.  The design is actually subtle, not obnoxious to me.Only thing: the back rubs on my Achilles as I walk.  I hope that stops.  Nothing a bit of moleskin can't fix.
B00C6EW87G Love 'Em I'm always looking for shoes that are flat and &#34;sleek&#34;--these fit the bill!  They are very light, soft, and comfortable.  I was glad I had read reviews to know that they run a tad bit on the small side.  I wear 9 1/2 or 10, so I knew I would order a 10 and they fit perfectly!
B00C6MI48A The Fit! Good sock but, it's fit is not really that good if you have a smaller foot size. The sock comes up my calf way to far, I was hoping to ware them with shorts this summer and I will have to fold them over and look like a 50's &#34;BobbySocker&#34;
B00C70T3W2 The size on the packaging reads "12 months" And the size on the tag on the clothing reads &#34;24 months&#34; so I don't know what to believe. I got it as a gift for my nephew and I didn't give it to him yet, so I don't know if it will fit him or not. Otherwise it seems very nice.
B00C71819M Great buy for boys....... I ordered these shorts for my 13 year old grandson who is not  really very  concerned about his appearance (or so it would seem) however there are things he will wear and things that he definitely will not wear. I'm happy to report that these shorts fell into the &#34;will&#34; category.They must be comfortable since he likes to sleep in them and would wear them continuously for several (4 OR 5) days if not for parental intervention. The fit is very good and they look very nice even after being worn wet. I would definitely buy more of these next year and recommend them to friends with young boys.
B00C7OLBV4 TOO CUTE! She loves them (paired with the colorful jacket)! Very cute and stylish...of course you can't go wrong with &#34;princess pink.&#34;
B00CAK6FVQ tight on the toes I LOVE the look of these shoes but I wore them around the house for about 30min while I was getting ready to go to dinner and they were so tight on my toes that they started to lose circulation. Im a &#34;no pain no gain&#34; kinda girl but only to a point. These shoes are just too stiff and too tight in the toes. They are a very narrow shoe also but with thin socks I was able to fit in them width wise. If they didnt hurt my toes I wouldve kept them. They are super cute and the foot bed is very well cushioned.
B00CFF65NY Should of ordered more... My daughter lovers her pink &#34;soccer shirt&#34;, got her the green  and black ones as well, but she only ever wants to wear this one. As for fit she is a small almost 3 yr. old and it seems to fit like most her other size 4 shirts.
B00CN5B73O Sporty and cute The size 4 fit my petite 4 year old perfect.  She wants to look &#34;awesome not cute&#34;, but I think this sweats outfit rides that fine balance well.  The material is thin, but that is fine as long as you are not looking for winter warmth.  It is perfect for layering as it does not add any bulk, and easy to put on before riding in car seat as again, too much bulk is not allowable in the car seat.
B00CN5B73O Nice hoodie, but CHEAP ZIPPER ! Purple is my granddaughter's favorite color. Searching for a good quality purple hoodie, I ordered this one. We LOVED it until the cheep zipper wouldn't work after only nine weeks of inconsistent use !!!  The &#34;return&#34; policy is only four weeks.  You would have thought a name brand like Puma would give it's customers better quality. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PUMA PRODUCT.
B00CN5C0RQ It's Okay The product description says &#34;Kids Girls 2-6X&#34;, I bought for my niece who lives in Brazil and has only five years, but it was small.I thought it would be perfect to be 6 but it did not fit.
B00CQG7DRO My 5 year old love this outfit Very nice looking on, and the best part is my 5 year old loves getting dressed when this outfit is &#34;in sight&#34;. Recommend this outfit. It is not a warm outfit for winter, unless worn with a sweat jacket. Recommend for Spring time when weather is a bit warmer out.
B00DNNOCQE Somethings not right I purchased these in the gray and like one other reviewer said, the left shoe was fine.  But the right shoe the back of the shoe pressed up against my foot and hurts.  The left is fine but something's not right with the &#34;right&#34; shoe.
B00DNNS0XA but they actually look great. I know that Pumas are a little snug ... I was a little concerned about the metal d-ring eyelets being a little too &#34;Euro&#34; looking, but they actually look great.  I know that Pumas are a little snug in their sizing, so you may not want to wear socks with these when you workout; also, this is trivial but may matter to some: the toe is a little more &#34;pointy&#34; than most trainers today.  The trend now is that of more rounded toes, like the NB naked or Merrell shoes.  These are awesome all-around running, working out, running errands shoes.
B00DNNYHHI Right shoe felt uncomfortable over the arch The description for this shoe did not lend itself to the fact that the &#34;300&#34; signifies that this shoe is good for short distance running. Meaning that the padding is going to be harder and so I had to return these. I tried it and it definitely was a harsher ride than my Nikes.Planning on trying out the Faas 1000 since the reviews say it has incredible padding.(When it says, fits as expected, I already knew that I had to buy a half to a full size larger to make it fit on my foot.)
B00DOEFG4Y I love these shoes I spent forever searching for a replacement for my previous version of these shoes which lasted me about 5-6 years. These are exactly what I was looking for, easily my favorite street shoe.Abnormally good arch support for a &#34;flat&#34;Canvas for a more breathable shoe (especially nice in the summer) but not the horrible thin canvas that most companies are doing so it doesn't cut in to your ankle. These actually have padding!It's too bad Puma doesn't make them anymore (to my knowledge).
B00DOEPQD0 Unfinished Product The inside of the sneaker has a &#34;removable insert&#34;, NOT FIXED in place. When removed, the unfinished product is exposed. I returned the first pair and received a replacement with the same issue. No need to say that the second pair was returned as well.It does not seem logical that a sneaker should be sold unfinished.I was not only disappointed, but extremely annoyed  to have had to go through the return process twice.A.J. Picard
B00DOEPQD0 crazy big I normally wear a size 8 and this size 8 was crazy big.  I knew it as soon I took it out of the box.  The looked great and they were a good price with free return shipping so &#34;no harm, no foul&#34;.
B00DOPGL42 Perfect These were for my grandson who will be dressed as the color &#34;blue&#34; for Halloween! Perfect fit, perfect color, great quality.
B00DQYYVAM Great shoes. Very comfortable. Great looking shoes and very comfortable. You can dress them up or down. Wish the &#34;italia&#34; word on the side was a little more noticeable.
B00DRUBPF4 I Love(d) It This is a very nice tank. I like the idea of the mesh back, plus the colors are beautiful and nice/bright...right out of the box. Then you wash it once or twice and it starts to look worn. I loved this right out of the pack but now that it has faded a bit, we'll reduce that love to &#34;like&#34;.I would recommend it. I love that my back can breathe while I exercise, and I like the semi-fitted fit.
B00DS6W6DW Pear Shape Perfection! I have a pear shape with thicker arms so, finding casual tshirts that cover the 25% of the hip without having to up-size and make you look larger than you really are, PUMA has pulled through! The cut is still feminine,  but NOT a baby doll top that's uncomfortable to wear at the gym...especially when you find yourself in a &#34;burpee&#34; or &#34;downward dog&#34; excercise. I always wanted to own some other PUMA apparel (aside from shoes) and I finally have what I want...and when I find something I like, I buy multiples - I own the black AND the white version. Wish there was more!!!
B00DUGLEYM nice shoes My grandson really likes his new shoes.  I got a real bargain on them.Thank you Amazon for the &#34;Lightening Deals&#34;.They are very nice looking too.
B00DUL6J7Y Not as expected I ordered this pair for my kid. I wanted a size she'd grow into and so I needed to get a pair that would last. That's why I thought this would be perfect. Since the price is about what they go for at Journey kidz and Stride Rite I thought this would be the real deal. However, I was disappointed with the quality- there is more synthetic than leather on the &#34;upper&#34; and the sole is definitely man made material. The Pumas I've bought in the past are softer, more pliable and good for growing feet. These were quite stiff probably because of the amount of plastic or whatever synthetic material is on the upper. At $50 I think I was paying for the BMW license rather than the quality of the shoes. If you must buy this online, compare to brick and mortar shoe stores' websites first.It's not worthy of the price I paid, but it's okay overall.
B00DULXWII Great sneakers. My 8 year old son loves these shoes.  When we took them out of the box he said &#34;these are even better than I thought they would be&#34;.  He has worn them every day since and says that they are very comfortable.  I love that I don't have to worry about his laces being untied all the time.  We ordered another pair in a different color.
B00DULYICC nice shoe for the price This is our second pair of Puma Future Cat Super Mesh Sneakers. The shoes are light weight and durable. My daughter wore them daily for PE and they kept their shape and held up. They are true to size and good for kids with wider feet.  We did have to change the inner soles after a while, but ordered a new purple pair because she outgrew the previous pink pair. The purple color is a lot nicer, not as &#34;girly&#34; and is less offensive for slightly older girls who are becoming tweens.
B00DY6160A Nice color and great fit Got these for my mom who was looking for a pair of casual sneakers she could wear that were still feminine and cute. These fit the bill! She loves the small wedge giving her small frame some height and liked the pink/orange color. Thought it would be too aggressive of a color but they were &#34;refreshing&#34;.
B00DY6160A Very comfy I love these shoes.  The fit is &#34;as expected&#34; - the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because one of the seams ripped.  I wear them often.  I would definitely buy them again because of the comfort.  Little pricey though.
B00DY6160A Very cute I really like them. Fit a &#34;little&#34; large, but very comfortable. I will probably buy the black ones in the future.
B00DY75DWQ Yikes, not good quality I ordered them for my daughter, looked at them with her and said &#34;no way Jose&#34;.  She did not even try them on.  She is in 6th grade and it looked like the shoes were built in layers, one to peel off the other.  Picture looks great!  Shoes looked not so good.  I wanted her to like them because they were less expensive and I like Puma:-)  I kept looking at them as I was putting them into the return box and saying, &#34;Wow, these didn't come close to my expectations!&#34;
B00DY789HM Very stylish and Cute! The Pump Classic Wedge Lace-up shoe is very comfortable.  I stand a good part of the day at work and there was no problem  with the 2&#34; wedge.  I ordered my true size, 5 1/2, and they fit perfectly.  Received many compliments on the style and color.
B00DY8YSD0 Actually the size advertised I first bought the PUMA Men's Drift Cat 5 Ferrari Leather Sneaker-size 11D and I could barely get my foot in them, they were so narrow! They were not width &#34;D&#34;, so I returned them. Then I found these, which the style appealed to me even more, because I was a wrestler in school and enjoyed wearing my wrestling shoes for normal wear. I purchased these as well, in a size 11D and they were actually the size advertised! They are very comfortable and I continue to get compliments from friends, neighbors, as well as people on the streets.  I can't afford a beautiful Ferrari,but at least I can afford their shoes and caps ;)
B00DYRVKYG Wayyy too small We ordered this as a Christmas gift. Ad presented item as Girls 7-16, Black, Large, so we expected a jacket that a 10-11 year-old could wear, it being a large jacket. The tag is marked &#34;L&#34; but this jacket won't fit anyone larger than a size 7. This should have been advertised as a &#34;S&#34;.
B00E0FZW5E I'm a little to old Even though I had to send it back because i'm to stupid to read &#34;KIDS&#34; on it. I'm 18 and 170lbs and was very sad. I sent it back and got my money in full 2 days later. Even before they got it. Still will be a great buy for the little kids.
B00EAH1B8E excellent I bought these for my daughter who loves them big time. Very good quality and not too wide for her narrow foot. I am particularly grateful for the length in centimetres provided alongside the show size - it helps immensely when you're ordering from Australia and really do not want to have to return anything.&#34;The best shoes I've ever had!&#34; says my daughter.
B00EDOMUYI Early Review These shoes fit well, are comfortable, and appear to be sturdier than their predecessor. When I bought these shoes a bit over a year ago, one of the shoes developed a hole over the big toe.  These shoes are better reinforced in this region, not just the canvas mesh of my first Puma Voltaics. The &#34;unattached&#34; tongue is a minor drawback in the newer shoes, but overall, I think these shoes are better built.  Time will tel....
B00EDOR4L2 Great Shoe I bought this shoe simply because of the great sales price. I'm so glad I did - they are light weight, comfortable, and have already become a favorite weekend shoe. I've used them to run around with the kids and walk around the neighborhood. No &#34;break in time&#34; needed.
B00EDOR4L2 I like these shoes I like these shoes. They are very comfortable. Also really like the color of  the shoe. Not &#34;loud&#34; . Excellent price.
B00EP03RHE Cute but..... I bought these with the intension of getting some &#34;wear&#34; out of them but these already fit my 5 month old daughter (kinda chubby 16lbs). The quality was not as expected and does not have much stretch.
B00ETI12AG True to size but wide for PUMA I like to buy PUMA brand shoes for my youngest daughter and myself, we have very narrow (long) feet and they generally fit us quite well. I picked these shoes up in a size 9 1/2 for my daughter who is generally between a 9 1/2 and a 10, she loved the shoes* but her toes reached the very end of the shoe. I thought they were pretty cute too and since I am somewhere between a 9 and a 9 1/2 myself, they fit perfectly. The only issue is the width of the shoe, they hang open a bit on each side and so the inner fabrication (not to my taste, more to my daughters) is visible. I kept the shoe because I got it on Amazon's &#34;My Habit&#34; for thirty dollars less than list price here. I thought the shoe, even with the fit issues, was worth it for that price. I took a star off here for the fit issue and then another star off for the shoes being overpriced at this time.Recommended with above reservations*One more item of some interest: my eldest daughter (she-of-the-normal-width-foot) thought these shoes looked &#34;Grandma&#34; because of the front flap. I didn't get that vibe from them and neither did the youngest.
B00EX92PUM Runs small Runs pretty small for a &#34;large.&#34; Otherwise, love it. Color is as posted, very well described, just runs small. Nice hoodie!
B00FB64HLG Comfortable, Fashionable, Puma Pro: Comfortable fit, length is long (size M will flow below the belt), high quality puma design on chest and smaller one on sleeve.Con: The neck has a corner that will dig into you once in a while if you zip it up to the edge of the puma logo (top side). The piece that digs in can be uncomfortable and hurt but it only happens on rare occasion.Overall: Quality design you'd expect from Puma, one of the better &#34;designs&#34; I've seen in a long time. The hood is also very comfortable and has full coverage for rain.
B00FFFROA4 Great quality Bottoms do run a bit slender....sometimes they pull down a bit in the back with bending, etc. Have purchased a few of these suits and my kids love them.  Fit seems to be &#34;right on&#34; with age.
B00FJ1RRHO I like the shoes.......but! I was pleased with the shoes.  They were a little tight at first but feel very comfortable now.What I was surprised at was that I received a message saying they had been &#34;shipped&#34; and they arrived one month later.I thought that perhaps they had someone walk them to my door.  Waiting a month for a delivery is unacceptable.  I wouldn't buy from this buyer again.
B00FME3LO6 For my grandson I purchased this for my 8 year old grandson.  He told me it is is favorite shirt.  I asked him what he liked about the shirt--he said &#34;I like the way it feels because it's soft and I really like the color.&#34;
B00FRG62HM Nice color - slightly large. The &#34;sunset orange&#34; color was not available as an image but I risked it and it is a very lovely orange (slightly coral).  A medium was a little large...she usually wears size 8.  We'll keep it though as it'll fit down the road.
B00FRK9HZC Shorts are the perfect addition to her wardrobe Even though these are &#34;boys&#34; shorts, I bought them for my preteen daughter. We've had a difficult time locating shorts like these and I was very pleased to find them at a great price and in excellent condition. Timely shipping, even though we were a little slow ordering them in time for Christmas, made this a pleasant transaction. Very happy.
B00FRL85WC Huge! I ordered these pants for my son -- age 8.  He is a smaller guy, but typically wears size 7/8 in pants, or size medium.  These pants are enormous -- they fit me, and I'm 5' 3&#34;!
B00GOMDKBO comfortable Received these as a gift. They are comfortable and fit well. Be sure to read the fit guide as it can be easily misleading. I wear a shoe size 7 and, apparently, that equates to a sock size of &#34;9-11&#34; I would have given them 5 stars but one of the socks somehow get a hole in the tow already, so that is disappointing.
B00GOMDKBO "Nice socks!" &#34;I enjoyed them and they really looks nice when I wear them with my Puma athletic shoes! I would recommend these socks to buy!&#34;
B00HSH997S Girls? No, more like adult. I ordered these for my little one, they said &#34;girls 9-11&#34; but they are adult, I have size 10 feet and I'm wearing them.
B00I9V1IGC These are for little kids This is not for &#34;boys&#34; this is for little kids.... size 6 for 10 year old is not size 6 for toddler...
B00I9V1IGC Too small - Not for Boys 8-20 as advertised These run very small, and it's next to impossible to figure out the sizing online, so of course, I ordered the wrong size the first time - size 7-8.5 - and they would probably fit a large toddler.I have been trying to find replacement Puma socks for some black Puma socks he's had for years that he absolutely LOVES.  These unfortunately, are not them...  I decided to order the largest size (9-11), and they &#34;just&#34; fit my size 5 shoe, 8 year old. I figure they'll last the summer, then he'll outgrow them (likely before they wear out).Other items of interest...  They are on the thinner side, which is great for summer (my son wears shoes all summer - rarely sandals).  He says they do NOT slip down into his shoe.  They &#34;fitted&#34; nicely.  They are not super stretchy - only a little stretch compared to other socks we own, and they have a typical cottony feel -  not super soft (like some of the cotton/poly blends), but not scratchy either.
B00IO6YCWY Glue on my hiney! If you work like I do and sweat, you will not like these as there is an &#34;iron-on&#34; tag in the back that comes off when you are hard at work and then the adhesive sticks to  your skin. Really annoying Needs to be an ink label in back rather than a rubberized iron-on tag.
B00IY2KHL8 Ughh. No where in the title or description does it say "Children's". I will, of course, change my rating if I can get a return, and the name/description changes to match the product. After searching for &#34;Men's socks&#34;, this was in the search results, so categories this is listed under must change as well.
